SVB stock plummeted 68% during Friday's premarket trading session before the halt after dropping more than 60% through Thursday, closing at $106 per share. CNBC's David Faber reported early Friday SVB's planned capital raise announced earlier this week had not cleared the market, and that the firm was now seeking to sell itself. Turmoil for SVB began when the California based bank filed a surprise announcement of a $1.8 billion loss following a deposit outflow and plans to raise $2.25 billion by selling common and preferred stock. Silicon Valley Bank primarily serves startups and technology firms, which have been under pressure as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.  Silicon Valley’s CEO Greg Becker urged calm with venture capitalists Thursday in a call, according to The Information, and asked them not to withdraw money. Bloomberg reported that venture capitalists have urged portfolio companies to trim their exposure to the lender. Another California bank that serves cryptocurrency clients, Silvergate Capital, announced a “voluntary liquidation” Wednesday, the same day Silicon Valley Bank announced its ill-fated capital raise. Shares were also halted in Signature Bank (SBNY), a New York institution that serves some cryptocurrency clients, after its shares dropped more than 16%. First Republic Bank (FRC), which serves some companies in the venture world and also targets high-net worth clients from the tech industry, saw shares fall as much as 40% early Friday. Concerns about risks to other banks spread on Thursday as stocks of giant financial institutions tumbled. A major bank index fell by the most Thursday in nearly three years. Shares for JP Morgan Chase (JPM) fell 5.41% Thursday and shares were roughly flat during Friday's open. Shares of Bank of America (BAC) fell 6.20% Thursday and opened Friday down more than 2%. Citigroup (C) shares fell 4.20% Thursday and opened Friday down more than 1%. Shares of Goldman Sachs Group (GS) fell 7.20% Thursday and an additional 2% Friday. In a Friday morning note, Morgan Stanley analysts said they don’t anticipate this SVB Financial’s challenges will cripple other regional banks. “The funding pressures facing SIVB are highly idiosyncratic and should not be viewed as a read-across to other regional banks,” according to the note. “We do not believe there is a liquidity crunch facing the banking industry, and most banks in our coverage have ample access to liquidity.” David Hollerith is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-10,aapl,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-today-live-updates-march-10-2023-123845899.html,"U.S. stock futures were mixed Friday morning ahead of a crucial jobs report that will provide another snapshot of the strength of the economy and provide further clues to the path of the Fed's rate-hiking campaign. Futures tied to the S&P 500 (^GSPC) were down 0.2% ahead of the open, while futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined 0.3%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) edged up by 0.1%. January’s job report blew past expectations, as the U.S. economy added more than half a million jobs and the unemployment rate dipped to 3.4%, a level not seen since 1969. But economists aren’t expecting another surprise for Friday’s February jobs print. Consensus estimates from economists are for job gains of 225,000, a slower pace from the January’s blowout number. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.4%. “Signs of slowing outnumber signs of strength, making the chance that last month was a fluke likely,” Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, wrote in a note Friday morning. “At the same time, labor demand continues strong, which suggests a significant drop is also unlikely. A return to the previous trend makes the most sense.” The Federal Reserve has been keeping a close eye on all fronts to the labor market as the central bank tries to cool down inflation. The Friday’s jobs print will show whether January’s hiring gain was an outlier or the start of economic acceleration. Another key point of focus will be wage growth — and whether or not the trend accelerated last month. Meanwhile, other recent data continues to show the economy remains resilient. Consumer spending surged in January, inflation stayed sticky, and business activity expanded in February. The accumulation of economic data, coupled with comments this week from Chair Jerome Powell, has sparked the debate on whether a 0.25% or 0.50% rate hike from the Fed is likely for its March meeting. However, recent events in the banking world have spurred other concerns for Fed officials as their monetary tightening policy induces stresses into the banking system. A major tech firm lender revealed it’s in deep trouble. Silicon Valley Bank’s (SIVB) share price tanked 60% on Thursday, wiping out $9.6 billion of market value after announcing it needs to raise $2.25 billion to offset a $1.8 billion loss on some bond sales. The sour sentiment has spread across markets as the KBW Bank index (^BKX) was down over 7%, while index members including Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) edged lower Friday morning in premarket trading. Elsewhere, in the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin (BTC) crumbled below $20,000 Friday amid liquidation of Silvergate Capital (SI) and regulatory pressures on the industry. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-10,aapl,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/february-jobs-report-march-10-2023-124602371.html,"The February jobs report is expected to show a slowdown in job growth from the start of 2023 while reinforcing the U.S. labor market remains strong even in the face of stubbornly high inflation. Economists expect nonfarm payrolls grew by 225,000 last month with the unemployment rate expected to hold steady at 3.4%, according to data from Bloomberg. The BLS will release its latest jobs figures at 8:30 a.m. ET. Here are the key figures investors will be looking for in Friday's report compared to January's figures, according to data from Bloomberg: Nonfarm payrolls: +225,000 vs. +517,000 Unemployment rate: 3.4% vs. 3.4% Average hourly earnings, month-on-month: +0.3% vs. +0.3% Average hourly earnings, year-on-year: +4.7% vs. +4.4% Labor force participation rate: 62.4% vs. 62.4% Average weekly hours worked: 34.6 vs. 34.7 Investors will be paying particularly close attention to revisions to January's data released Friday morning, as investors saw the unexpectedly strong 517,000 jobs created to start the year as a potential outgrowth of seasonal adjustment factors or favorable weather. ""Given the potential impact of weather and seasonality effects in January there is the possibility of another shock last month, albeit mainly to the downside this time,"" wrote Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients earlier this month. Ashworth expects job gains in February will tally 200,000 just below consensus estimates. Friday's report also comes less than two weeks before the Federal Reserve's next policy meeting, with markets now expecting the central bank will raise interest rates by a more aggressive 0.50%. Fed Chair Jay Powell told lawmakers this week ""the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated."" Data from the CME Group shows markets pricing in an 60% of a 0.50% rate hike on March 22. An employment report that is in-line with expectations could clinch that more aggressive move later this month.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. For the last year, the Federal Reserve has tried to accomplish one goal, using one tool — lower inflation by raising interest rates. The result has been benchmark interest rates rising by 4.5% in a year and headline inflation falling from a peak of 9.1% in June to 6.4% as of January. As Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated in testimony on Capitol Hill this week, there is still work to be done for the Fed to achieve its goal. But over the last week, acute challenges at two banks have surfaced another issue now facing the Powell Fed. And that is the stability of the financial system. On Wednesday, Silvergate Capital (SI), which had become one of the crypto industry's biggest banking partners, announced it will liquidate and wind down operations after suffering significant deposit outflows from its digital asset clients. That same day, Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB), the preferred banking partner of the venture and startup worlds, announced it would take a $1.8 billion loss while liquidating its entire short-term securities book and raising $2.25 billion fresh capital. In a letter to investors, CEO Greg Becker assured investors the bank had ""ample liquidity,"" and said it took these actions ""because we expect continued higher interest rates, pressured public and private markets, and elevated cash burn levels from our clients as they invest in their businesses."" The Information reported Thursday afternoon Becker told investors on a call, ""I would ask everyone to stay calm and to support us just like we supported you during the challenging times."" Few statements have a tougher audience than investors being told to remain calm in times of market stress. On Thursday, U.S. stocks got crushed during a steady, relentless sell-off that centered on the financial sector. Regional banks were hammered. Big banks were hammered. The S&P 500 fell 1.8%. Bitcoin fell 7%. The challenge for Powell, however, is that some of the stress facing Silicon Valley Bank has been induced by the Fed's actions to fight inflation. And the fear is they may not be alone. In the simplest terms, Silicon Valley Bank took a nearly $2 billion hit selling bonds at a loss to buy different bonds that offer a higher yield. The firm's latest annual report showed the bank owned about $14 billion in Treasury securities with an average maturity between 1-5 years. Today, 1-year Treasury bills yield 5.25%. One day's drop in the stock market, of course, is not cause for concern about the financial system. Even the liquidation of one bank and deep investor concerns about another need not constitute a Fed-level worry about the U.S. banking system. But these moves serve as reminders that while the central bank's role in raising or lowering interest rates has become the focal point of investor attention over the last decade, the Fed also serves the central role in stabilizing markets and quelling investor fears during uncertain moments like the present. Almost exactly three years ago, Powell held an emergency Sunday night call on March 15, 2020 to announce a series of measures aimed at supporting the economy as the pandemic rapidly shut down global business. On that call, Powell reminded the assembled press, ""[That] central banks were originally designed to ...provide liquidity to financial systems in stress, so we take that job very seriously. It's probably the most important thing we're doing now is that."" Rising anxiety in the banking system as the ripples from a crypto collapse in 2022 and the icing over of a red hot venture market pale in comparison to the financial emergency the Fed faced three years ago. But their actions then were a reminder of the central bank's power, and, indeed, its centrality to financial markets. When the February jobs report is released Friday morning, investors will pore over the data to decipher whether a 0.25% or 0.50% rate hike from the Fed is likely warranted on March 22. This is the moment markets have been building towards for weeks. But the unforeseen stress now being injected into the banking system makes Friday and the days ahead notable for the Fed in an entirely different manner. That presents to Jay Powell another wrinkle in the challenge of trying to bring order to an economy that busted and boomed in a few short months.

2023-03-10,aapl,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/why-silicon-valley-banks-crisis-is-rattling-americas-biggest-banks-121159393.html,"The problems of two small banks on the West Coast are rippling across markets and causing new investor concerns about some of the country’s largest financial institutions. Why? Three words: rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve’s aggressive campaign to bring down inflation helped set the stage for major problems at two California lending institutions — SVB Financial (SIVB) and Silvergate Capital (SI) — as an outflow of deposits forced both to sell assets at a loss. Those assets were bonds. Banks are big investors in assets like Treasury bills because they need lots of safe places to park their cash. Many financial institutions piled into these investments during a period of historically-low interest rates that spanned the early years of the pandemic, as banks took in tons of new deposits and lending was somewhat restrained. But now the Fed is hiking rates at a rapid clip, with Fed Chair Jay Powell warning earlier this week the central bank may have to speed up the pace of its rate increases to cool the economy further. The problem that creates for banks is simple: higher rates lower the value of their existing bonds. The withdrawals at SVB's Silicon Valley Bank have come from startups and technology firms, many of which also ran into new trouble once the Fed began raising rates. The deposit outflow forced SVB to sell assets and take a $1.8 billion loss, a move the bank it made “because we expect continued higher interest rates, pressured public and private markets, and elevated cash-burn levels from our clients as they invest in their businesses.” Its shares fell more than 60% Thursday. In pre-market trade on Friday SVB shares were down another 60% after overnight reporting from Bloomberg said VC firms ranging from Peter Thiel's Founder Fund to Union Square Ventures had told portfolio companies to pull their money from Silicon Valley Bank. Banks don't have to realize losses on bonds that may have gone down in value amid rising rates if they're not pushed to sell these assets. But Silvergate Capital and SVB Financial didn’t have that choice. Customer withdrawals at Silvergate Bank and SVB’s Silicon Valley Bank forced their hand. At Silvergate, which caters to cryptocurrency clients, customers yanked their money in the panic that followed the 2022 collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Silvergate said in January that it had realized losses of $886 million from selling securities as deposits fell. That weakened the bank considerably. On Wednesday it said it would wind down its bank, and its shares plunged Thursday. After disclosing the $1.8 billion loss and new capital raise, Silicon Valley’s CEO Greg Becker urged calm in a call with venture capitalists Thursday, according to The Information, asking these investors not to withdraw money. It now is seeking to raise $2.25 billion of new capital to cover the new losses. The concern now among investors is that much bigger banks could be forced to do the same. That sent the stocks of giant financial institutions tumbling Thursday, including the biggest of the big: JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC). A major bank index fell by the most Thursday in nearly three years. The biggest U.S. banks are much stronger than they were in the lead up to the last big banking crisis, in 2008, in part because regulators forced them to hold more capital and survive numerous stress test scenarios over the last decade and a half. And the giants have more diverse funding and customer bases than banks such as Silicon Valley or Silvergate, which gives them many more options during challenging times. Longtime banking analyst Mike Mayo said Thursday during an appearance on CNBC the biggest banks are ""a pillar of strength and stability"" and much more resilient than they were prior to the 2008 crisis. ""The biggest risks are outside the largest banks,"" he said, and yet all banks are ""getting painted with the same brush."" Bank stocks, he said, ""have gotten Powelled,"" referring to the Fed chair. ""Going from zero to 5% interest rates in a period that is faster than any time in four decades, you are going to have casualties."" Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chair Martin Gruenberg highlighted the new interest rate risks facing the industry during a speech on March 6, noting that unrealized losses on available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities totaled $620 billion at the end of 2022 across all U.S. banks. ""The current interest rate environment has had dramatic effects on the profitability and risk profile of banks’ funding and investment strategies,"" he said. ""First, as a result of the higher interest rates, longer term maturity assets acquired by banks when interest rates were lower are now worth less than their face values. The result is that most banks have some amount of unrealized losses on securities."" These unrealized losses, he added, ""weaken a bank’s future ability to meet unexpected liquidity needs."" The good news, according to Gruenberg, is that ""banks are generally in a strong financial condition, and have not been forced to realize losses by selling depreciated securities.""

2023-03-09,aapl,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-today-live-updates-march-9-2023-135006552.html,"Stocks got crushed on Thursday as worries rippled through the banking sector and investors remained on edge ahead of a crucial February jobs report slated for Friday morning. At the closing bell, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down 1.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was off by 1.6%, or 542 points, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down by 2%. Through Thursday's close the market was on pace for its worst week of the year, Bloomberg data showed. The selling on Thursday accelerated throughout the trading session as a collapse in shares of SVB Financial (SIVB) pressured bank stocks and raised concerns over previously unforeseen knock-on effects from the Federal Reserve's rate hiking campaign on the financial system. On Wednesday, SVB announced a $2.25 billion capital raise and the sale of nearly all of its securities portfolio for a loss of $1.8 billion. The company's Silicon Valley Bank subsidiary is the bank for many startups and other players in the venture world. In a letter to investors on Wednesday, the company said: ""We are taking these actions because we expect continued higher interest rates, pressured public and private markets, and elevated cash burn levels from our clients as they invest in their businesses."" The Information reported Thursday afternoon Greg Becker, CEO of Silicon Valley Bank, said on a call with investors, ""I would ask everyone to stay calm and to support us just like we supported you during the challenging times."" Becker also reportedly told investors the bank has ""ample liquidity,"" but said that ""if everyone is telling each other SVB is in trouble, that would be a challenge."" SVB shares fell 60% on Thursday. This decline also weighed on regional banks, with the SPDR Regional Banking ETF (KRE) falling 8% while the SPDR Financial Sector ETF (XLF) fell some 4%. Among major U.S. money-center banks, shares of JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), and Wells Fargo (WFC) were all down more than 5% on Thursday. First Republic Bank (FRC), which maintains a large high net-worth clients business, saw shares fall 16% during Thursday's trading session. As Bloomberg's Jonathan Ferro tweeted, Thursday seems to have marked the moment in the rate-hiking cycle that higher rates are good for banks until they are no longer good. Earlier Thursday, labor market data had been the main catalyst for the market as investors await a crucial jobs report set for release Friday morning. The weekly report on initial filings for unemployment insurance Thursday morning showed 211,000 claims were filed last week, an increase of 21,000 from the prior weak and what economists at Oxford Economics called the ""first hint of weakness"" in this data. ""The jump in jobless claims to 211k last week from 190k is the first sign of weakness in the claims data this year but is still well short of the 300k+ level that would be consistent with a recession,"" Michael Pearce, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients. ""As the Fed presses ahead with more rate hikes, we expect layoffs to eventually rise significantly."" The initial pop from stocks following this data came after two days of testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made clear interest rates are likely to go higher than expected amid strong labor market and inflation data. Stocks finished Wednesday's trading session mixed after a sell-off Tuesday that was triggered by comments from Powell suggesting the Fed will need to raise rates higher than previously forecasted amid stubborn inflation. ""I was surprised by Powell's willingness to accelerate the policy tightening pace, but I am not surprised by the admission that terminal rates will need to rise further,"" said Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro. ""At present, the futures market is priced for a [50 basis point] move in March. There is no point cracking open a door if you don’t intend to walk through."" Data from the CME Group shows markets placing an 80% on the Fed raising rates by 0.50% later this month. Elsewhere in markets, WTI crude oil fell about 1.5% to trade near $75.50 a barrel, a retreat from the $80 a barrel oil was trading near earlier this week. Investors were also keeping a close eye on the Treasury market with the 10-year yield firmer by about 5 basis points, trading at 3.92% after a move higher in yields earlier this week led to a deepening inversion of the yield curve. In single-stock news, shares of Silvergate (SI) were in focus on Thursday after the bank said late Wednesday it would liquidate and wind down its operations after suffering heavy losses amid huge deposit outflows from its digital asset client base. Shares of Silvergate, which have lost more than 95% over the last year, fell 41% on Thursday. Other stocks on the move on Thursday included MongoDB (MDB), which fell 8.3% following a disappointing quarterly report. On the flip side, shares of Asana (ASAN) gained 19% Thursday after a surprisingly strong quarter.

2023-03-09,aapl,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/banks-tumble-svb-ignites-broader-173433069.html,"By Sinéad Carew (Reuters) - The S&P 500 bank index tumbled nearly 6% on Thursday in its biggest one-day drop in over two years as investors fled the industry following SVB Financial Group's share sale announcement and crypto bank Silvergate's decision to wind down operations. Shares of SVB, whose operating segments include Silicon Valley Bank, slumped over 50% in their deepest one-day drop on record after the company announced a $1.75 billion share sale late on Wednesday. SVB is battling cash burn due to declining deposits from startups struggling with a venture capital funding drought. San Francisco headquartered First Republic slumped 15% after hitting its lowest level since October 2020. The SPDR S&P regional banking ETF dropped more than 7% to its lowest level since January 2021. Major U.S. banks were also hit, with JPMorgan and Bank of America both down more than 5%. First Republic and SVB were the S&P 500's deepest percentage decliners in Thursday's trading session, while JPMorgan's loss weighed more than any other stock on the S&P 500's 1.1% decline at mid-day. ""The Silicon Valley raise got everybody nervous about people's capital levels and what deposits are doing. A lot of institutional investors don't feel great about owning certain banks right now,"" said R.J. Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. ""It just gets people freaked out because Silicon Valley, historically has been a very strong, well-run bank. If they're having issues right now, people are wondering what about other banks that are lesser quality and that don't have the reputation that Silicon Valley Bank has."" Investors were also grappling with the decline of cryptocurrency-focused lender Silvergate Capital, which dropped 22% after saying late on Thursday it planned to wind down operations and voluntarily liquidate after it was hit with losses following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. Shares in Silvergate peer Signature bank fell 9.4%.

2023-03-09,aapl,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/mortgage-rates-increase-again-flirt-with-7-170227323.html,"Mortgage rates surged higher this week, closing in on 7%, further cementing affordability concerns in the housing market. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage increased to 6.73% from 6.65% the week prior, according to Freddie Mac. Rates have climbed nearly three-quarters of a point since the beginning of February. The jump in rates continued to fuel the standoff between price-struck homebuyers and hesitant sellers, as elevated home prices weigh on already weak demand ahead of the spring season. Add to that the expectation that rates could soon crest 7% if inflation remains a top concern. “It's not just higher mortgage rates, but really the combination of higher mortgage rates and still higher home prices in most markets that are creating hurdles for buyers,” Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale, told Yahoo Finance. “Even though a greater share of home sellers in today's market have adjusted their price lower, both listing and sale prices have continued to climb on a year-over-year basis.” While the volume of applications to purchase a home increased by 7% for the week ending March 3, overall purchase activity was 42% lower than a year ago, the Mortgage Bankers Association latest survey found. “Even with this jump in activity, both purchase and refinance applications remain well below year-ago levels when rates were much lower,” MBA President and CEO Bob Broeksmit told Yahoo Finance. “The recent increase in mortgage rates, right at the start of the busy spring buying season, could cause prospective buyers to delay decisions until rates moderate.” Buyers still in the market also have to contend with higher list prices from sellers. The national median listing price increased to $415,000 in February, Realtor.com data showed, up from $406,000 the previous month and up 7.8% year over year. That reverses several months of softening listing prices after peaking in June at $449,000, and could suggest that sellers are getting stubborn in offering incentives. Without wiggle room on prices, buyers are seeing their purchasing power evaporate amid rising interest rates. For instance, the monthly mortgage payment for a median-priced home is 49% higher than a year ago at last week’s rate of 6.65%, according to Realtor.com. Buyers are likely to face further affordability challenges entering the spring, Hale noted, because too-low inventory will continue to buoy home prices. “One big reason that home prices continue to climb is that even though we have more homes for sale today, the market is still not back to what was common before the pandemic in most places,” Hale said. “And fewer homes for sale mean there's still some pressure on prices even though buyers are more selective amid higher costs.” As homebuyer demand remains weak, home sellers are feeling more pessimistic and are much less active than last year. There were 15.9% fewer homes listed for sale in February compared with last year, data from Realtor.com showed. Meanwhile, there’s some evidence that sellers are a bit less generous with buyer incentives. For instance, 57% of builders used incentives to close sales in February, the National Association of Home Builders said, down from 62% in December and 59% in November. A growing share of sellers are also pulling back on price reductions, more so than what is typical during this time of the year. According to Realtor.com, 13% of home sellers issued a price cut in February, up from 5.4% a year ago. Still, in January at least 15.3% of sellers lowered their prices to make a sale. Mortgage rates have been marching higher since February after government data revealed the inflation remains a threat. This week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell made it clear to Congress that he isn’t ready to soften his aggressive fight on inflation, indicating that further rate hikes would likely be necessary as we enter the spring. That could likely keep mortgage rates higher. Though “forecasting is far more art than science,” Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com, anticipates that mortgage rates are likely to climb higher before they retreat later this year. “At present, and while there is a chance that rates could retreat to recent bottom levels or perhaps a little below at some point, much depends on what happens with prices, with the Fed, and ultimately whether or not the economy gets to a tipping point and starts to head into recession,” Gumbinger recently told Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-09,aapl,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/9-ways-biden-is-set-to-raise-some-taxes-in-2024-budget-proposal-145357176.html,"President Biden is set to lay out vast and expensive ambitions in his 2024 budget Thursday from shoring up Medicare and boosting domestic spending to reducing the deficit by nearly $3 trillion over the coming decade. To pay for it all, he plans to propose a slate of tax increases, according to multiple peeks at the budget administration officials gave in recent days. There are new taxes on the business world focused on raising the rate on corporate income and on stock buybacks. He will also propose new taxes on wealthy Americans — from changes to how investment income is taxed to a revival of his ""billionaire minimum tax"" on wealth. “I want to make it clear I’m going to raise some taxes,” President Biden said during a recent stop in Virginia, offering one of his many previews of what's to come. Of course, presidential budget proposals are largely symbolic documents that are more about staking out a position rather than being enacted. But they serve as an important marker of Biden’s priorities for the year ahead. “What the president has really here to use is the bully pulpit, meaning once he puts his budget forward, is he going to continue to push some of those ideas?” asked Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget President Maya MacGuineas in a Yahoo Finance Live interview on Wednesday. “If he's serious about it, he'll push it.” Here are some of the new taxes set to be unveiled on Thursday In his budget, President Biden is set to renew his long-standing calls for more taxes on Corporate America. Included in a New York Times preview of the budget document are Biden’s desire to raise the corporate income tax rate to 28% from its current level of 21%. The president is also set to renew his call to quadruple the recently enacted excise tax on stock buybacks, a change he first offered earlier this year during his State of the Union address. On Jan. 1, a new 1% tax on share repurchases went into effect, but has done little to damp business enthusiasm for the practice. The provision is currently set to bring in about $74 billion over the coming decade, and Biden is proposing to increase the rate to 4%. And according to a document reviewed by Reuters, the budget will also propose scrapping tax breaks that oil and gas companies receive. That could likely open up another front in the back and forth between the White House and oil companies over record profits they've enjoyed since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The new proposals come after last year’s Inflation Reduction Act imposed multiple new taxes on businesses, including the 1% stock buyback excise tax and a new corporate book minimum tax. Going after more taxes so shortly after last year's victory likely will inflame critics. Erica York, a senior economist at the Tax Foundation, argued in an interview Wednesday with Yahoo Finance that Biden’s policies were already “heading in the wrong direction and the president's budget is going to double down on that.” “I would say wait and see how it plays out before you double down or quadruple down on it,” she added. Biden is also set to propose new taxes on Americans making over $400,000 a year. The president rolled out his most controversial proposal during this year’s State of the Union with a potential new tax that would target wealth, not just income. “We have to reward work, not just wealth,” President Biden said in his speech. “No billionaire should be paying a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter.” According to a preview offered to Bloomberg, the president will lay out new details on that, including a call for a 25% minimum tax on households worth more than $100 million as well as an increase in the capital gains rate for wealthy Americans. Other tax ideas that were present in previous budgets are set to be revived for 2024, including ending the so-called carried-interest loophole and eliminating some tax breaks around real-estate profits. All told, the various increases would fund nearly $3 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade and also fund other Biden priorities. The deficit reduction will come in a budget that “achieves this while lowering costs for families, investing in America, and protecting programs Americans have paid into because it proposes tax reforms to ensure the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share, while cutting wasteful spending on special interests — interests like Big Oil and Big Pharma,” Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Wednesday. Finally, the White House previewed new taxes to shore up the Medicare program earlier this week. Biden will propose increases on payroll taxes on Americans making over $400,000 per year; closing loopholes that shields some “pass-through” income from Medicare taxes; and allowing Medicare to negotiate on a wider array of prescription drugs. Those provisions, which Biden reviewed in a New York Times op-ed on Tuesday, would extend the program through 2050. Critics have noted that many of these proposals would be untested ways to fund the health care program for retirees. York also noted that some of the rule changes around the net investment income tax would help Medicare's finances by diverting some money from the government’s general fund. “Of course that looks like you're strengthening Medicare, but you're creating a hole in the budget elsewhere,” she said, noting the plan also increases the net investment income tax from 3.8% to 5% and would therefore also bring in more money overall. Republicans have been promising for weeks that Biden’s proposals won’t see the light of day. This is hardly new — there's an old saying in Washington about budgets that “the president proposes and Congress disposes” — but it will nevertheless increase pressure on House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) to offer his own proposal in the coming months. MacGuineas, who previewed the dueling proposals, noted that the White House budget will likely focus on tax increases and the GOP plan will revolve around spending cuts. “Neither of them is realistic, and, frankly, neither of them is the right policy,” she said. “We need compromises on both.” Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. Fed chair Jay Powell just poured cold water on the ""no landing"" crowd hoping to avert a U.S. recession and rally stocks to fresh record highs this year. After two days of grilling before Congress, investors have been reminded (again) that the Fed chief still sees inflation as a persistent, pernicious threat. Stocks and bonds took notice Wednesday, as both sold off amid surging short-term rates — leaving the major indices underwater for the week as of the close. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes,"" said Powell before the Senate. And with two weeks to go until the next Fed meeting, markets are now expecting exactly that. Bonds and derivatives are pricing in a more hawkish outcome — expecting the Fed to lift its benchmark rate 50 basis points instead of 25 basis points. Since Monday's settlement, the U.S. 2-year Treasury-Note yield has surged 18 basis points to 5.06% — the highest level since 2007. It also deepened its inversion over the 10-year yield, with the spread reaching negative 108 basis points (or -1.08 percentage points) — the highest since the early 1980s when Paul Volcker was the Fed chair fighting a similar battle over price inflation. Under normal conditions, interest rates of longer-term loans or bonds (the cost of money) are expected to be more expensive than their shorter-term counterparts, as risk is higher on the long end. But this changes when the Fed starts stamping out animal spirits, lifting short-term rates to restrict the creation of credit and eventually choke off growth. While the magnitude, or depth, of a yield curve inversion isn't necessarily predictive of a deeper, or longer recession, there are a host of other indicators in the bond market that are sounding alarm bells. Former bond trader and CEO of TheMacroCompass.com Alfonso Peccatiello recently joined Yahoo Finance Live to offer his insights. Peccatiello notes that the bond market expects the Fed to fight inflation and remain tight, with interest rates well over 5% a year from now. ""That cannot happen if a recession is unfolding. The Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates,"" he said. Essentially, the inflation-fighting credibility that Powell has earned in the markets comes with a cost — pushing expectations of Fed capitulation far beyond what occurs historically. ""The issue is — the tighter you keep borrowing conditions for the private sector, the higher you keep mortgage rates, the higher you keep corporate borrowing rates — the higher the chances you're going to freeze these credit markets and basically sleepwalk into an accident or, in general, accelerate a recession later on,"" said Peccatiello. But long before the Fed delivers relief in the form of cuts, Peccatiello expects stocks to suffer from an earnings recession, which, he says, ""isn't fully priced in."" (An earnings recession — marked by two consecutive quarterly declines in S&P 500 earnings — often, but not always precedes an economic recession.) Peccatiello believes the U.S. is already in an earnings recession, with stocks reflecting complacency. Nevertheless, he doesn't expect a disaster. He sees about 10% maximum downside risk in the S&P 500 down to the 3600 level, which is right around last year's lows. ""I don't think it's going to be much lower than that,"" he says, adding, ""[T]he stock market generally bottoms before earnings bottom."" The reason gets back to the Fed, which historically capitulates and slashes rates as earnings drop. The Fed rate cuts then get incorporated into better stock valuations, which eventually halt the decline in stock prices, Peccatiello added. ""[This] means the stock market can stop its decline and start slowly but surely moving into a new bull market.""

""We have not made any decision,"" he told the House Financial Services Committee, saying key reports on employment and inflation would govern any moves. The remarks came a day after he told the Senate Banking Committee that, ""we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes"" if the data supported it. That spurred traders to price in a higher chance of a 0.50% hike than a 0.25% increase later this month. “We're going to be looking at the totality of data,"" Powell said Wednesday during questioning from House members. ""We are not on a preset path,"" he added. Powell said the Fed wants to see the upcoming employment report Friday, along with key inflation reports on the consumer and producer price indexes, before making a judgment. On Wednesday, the Dow dropped 0.18%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.14%, and the Nasdaq rose 0.40%. When asked by Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D, Mass.) whether the Fed would pause interest rates to avoid a recession, the chairman called it a serious question and noted that he wouldn’t say yes or no. The Fed, he said, is not ""seeking a recession."" Powell also said the era of low interest rates is likely over. ""Now, we have the 10-year [Treasury yield] back close to 4%,"" said Powell. ""And I think, we need to be careful not to assume that these secular low, longer term rates, will continue indefinitely because it doesn't look likely now."" Democrats, including Democratic Ranking Member Maxine Waters (D, CA) asked him to comment on the prospect of a U.S. default if Congress is not able to raise the debt ceiling. Powell warned that the Fed can’t protect the economy from brinksmanship or a default. ""No one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the non-payment of the government's bills, let alone a debt default, which I don't think will happen, but no one should think we have the tools to protect against the effects of that,"" said Powell. When asked whether the Fed would accept a trillion-dollar coin to avoid a debt default, Powell said there are no rabbits to be pulled out of hats and that would be a ""rabbit coming out of a hat."" House Republicans expressed concerns about reviewing and potentially increasing capital requirements for banks. Patrick McHenry, the chairman of the House committee, questioned the motivation of a ""holistic review"" of these requirements from the Fed’s Vice Chair of Supervision Michael Barr, saying the Fed shouldn’t operate in the shadows when the regulation in question can have broad and significant economic effects. McHenry also accused the Fed of laying the groundwork for a new climate policy. ""The Fed needs to stick to its knitting,"" said McHenry. ""I agree there is concern for many that the Fed is picking up new needles and knitting partisan sweaters at such a precarious time for our economy here at home in the global economy. That would be a mistake."" Powell’s comments Wednesday were his last before the Fed’s policy meeting in two weeks.

2023-03-08,aapl,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-march-8-2023-124051164.html,"U.S. stocks finished mixed on Wednesday, following two job prints that showed the labor market remains tight amid sticky inflation. Wall Street also heard from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday morning. Powell continued to stress that ""no decision"" has been made on the size of the Fed's upcoming interest-rate increase at its March policy meeting. ""When say we will look at the totality of data, that will include these next reports. We will carefully analyze. Haven't made a decision on the March meeting. Larger point is that we are not on a preset path,"" said Powell during his second day of testimony before Congress. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended the day up 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined by 0.2%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added 0.4%. Bond yields inched higher alongside a stronger dollar. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked up to 3.98% Wednesday. U.S. stocks plummeted Tuesday after Powell said during his Senate Banking Committee testimony that interest rates may rise “higher” than previously expected as the Fed continues a persistent fight against inflation. Powell’s comments on Capitol Hill triggered a 1.5% selloff in equities, according to JP Morgan’s trading desk. Tuesday’s losses saw every sector lower, with financials and real estate logging the biggest declines for the day. Treasury yields were higher, with the 2-year yield tipping above 5%, while the spread between the 10-year and 2-year US Treasury yields inverted for the first time since September 1981. According to strategists at Deutsche Bank, reaching this level signals a recession could be underway or has occurred within a maximum of eight months. “Powell’s speech indicates that the Fed will heavily depend on near-term data for upcoming rates decisions,” Michael Feroli, Chief U.S. Economist at JP Morgan, wrote in a note Wednesday morning. ""With January’s macro data mostly printing on the hawkish side, NFP Friday and CPI next Tuesday are the most critical catalysts for Fed’s decision between 25bp and 50bp,” Feroli added. Still, on the economic data side, ADP’s monthly read on private payroll growth rose by 242,000 in February, above consensus expectations for 200,000. ADP also tracked pay growth for those workers who stayed in their position, which decelerated to 7.2% last month, the slowest pace of gains within in the last year. “There is a tradeoff in the labor market right now,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist, ADP, wrote in the press release. ""We're seeing robust hiring, which is good for the economy and workers, but pay growth is still quite elevated. The modest slowdown in pay increases, on its own, is unlikely to drive down inflation rapidly in the near term.” Meanwhile, the U.S. monthly international trade deficit increased to $68.3 billion in January, below the consensus deficit of $68.7 billion as imports increased more than exports, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the U.S. Census Bureau. Another highlight Wednesday morning was January’s report on the number of job openings, which fell to 10.82 million, down from the upwardly revised 11.2 million openings in the prior month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. The construction, leisure, hospitality, and finance industries showed significant pullbacks in job openings. ""While the January JOLTS report shows job openings are heading in the right direction for the Fed, the decline is far too modest to convince that labor market conditions are cooling enough to bring down inflation,"" Matthew Martin, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a statement following the release. February’s jobs report out on Friday will hold more clues about the strength of the economy. Economists expect 215,000 new jobs will be added to the economy, a slower pace than January’s blowout number of 517,000 job additions. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.4%. Another key point from the reading will be wage growth, with a 0.3% month-to-month bump in average hourly earnings anticipated and 4.7% over the last year. In single-stock moves, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) gained over 2% Wednesday after a regulatory filing revealed that Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway bought nearly 6 million shares of the oil company in recent days, raising its stake in the company to 200.2 million shares worth $12.2 billion. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD) shares rose 3% Wednesday after the security software provider reported fourth-quarter earnings that topped analysts' expectations and issued stronger guidance for the fiscal first quarter. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) dipped 3% as Berenberg analyst Adrian Yanoshik slashed his rating on the stock from buy to hold, citing ""based on misplaced fears of a price war – appears to have been accepted by the market,"" Yanoshik noted. Separately, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened an investigation into the Model Y SUV over a concern with its steering wheels. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-08,aapl,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/key-recession-indicator-yield-inversion-treasury-160255114.html,"The Treasury market is sending its sharpest warning about recession risks since 1981. On Tuesday, the difference in the yield on 2-year and 10-year Treasury notes further inverted, with the yield on the 10-year falling 103 basis points, or 1.03 percentage points, below the yield on the 2-year yield. This dynamic has preceded each of the last eight U.S. recessions. By this measure, the yield curve has been inverted since July of last year as investors bet aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve to combat inflation would tip the economy into recession. In an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled the central bank will likely be more aggressive than it previously forecast in raising interest rates this year as inflation proves stubborn and the labor market remains strong. ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,"" Powell told the Senate Banking Committee in prepared remarks. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes."" ""Although inflation has been moderating in recent months, the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy,"" Powell added. The Fed will announce its next policy decision on March 22, a statement that will also be accompanied by new projections on where Fed officials see interest rates headed over the rest of this year and the next two. Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients Tuesday that Powell ""opened the door for the central bank to accelerate the pace of rate hikes and raise the target range of the fed funds rate more than anticipated because of the recent hot data on job growth and inflation."" Sweet noted investors are now pricing in 100 basis points of additional rate hikes from the Fed this year, up from the 75 basis points previously expected by most economists. Data from the CME Group showed Wednesday morning markets are now pricing in a nearly 80% chance the Fed raises rates by 50 basis points, or 0.50%, at its meeting later this month. As Yahoo Finance's Brian Cheung noted last year, there is nothing about Treasury yields themselves, or the relationship between the yield at any two points along the curve, that signals recession. Rather, it is what yields imply about future interest rates — and in turn future economic growth — that offers worrying signs for investors. While it is hotly debated what, exactly, ""goes into"" the yield for any Treasury security, a simple axiom used by many investors says Treasury yields indicate what the expected average of the fed funds rate, or the Fed's benchmark interest rate, will be over a given time period. With the 2-year yield standing at around 5% as of Wednesday morning, this implies investors think the fed funds rate will be, on average, 5% over the next two years. Today, the fed funds rate stands at roughly 4.6%, as the Fed's target interest rate range is 4.5%-4.75% following its decision last month to raise rates an additional 25 basis points. Therefore, we can say investors are anticipating the Fed will raise rates to at least 5% and keep them there for two years, or raise rates above 5% for some period of time before cutting them such that the average Fed funds rate is 5%. Duke professor Campbell Harvey, who uncovered this ""recession indicator"" in the 1980s, told Bloomberg in an interview earlier this year he thinks the economy can avoid recession despite warnings coming from his work. In part, in Harvey's view, this is because market awareness of this indicator has lessened its potency as a predictive measure. Notably, Harvey's worked actually focused on the spread between the 3-month Treasury bill and the 10-year Treasury note as the most potent recession indicator, not the now-popular 2-year/10-year spread. The spread between these two tenors along the curve currently stands at minus 107 basis points, still a clear recession signal by Harvey's work.

In exchange for capturing this difference between the wholesale and retail cost of goods, retailers take on the financial risk of fronting money to one party while working to make it back and then some from another. At the scale of the U.S. consumer economy, the differences between an additional week in a quarter, an additional weekend in a month, or even an additional day in a year can be millions of dollars or more. And if the timing of a day or two can disrupt the financial fortunes of a business — meaning there can be just hours between profits and losses — then one can imagine the challenges faced by retailers during the supply chain disruptions that results from the pandemic. In 2021, the story was that retailers were unable to match consumer demand as the economy re-opened. In 2022, supply chains that got unstuck eventually left retailers with more stock than they needed. As 2023 gets underway, retailers are suggesting the balance may finally be just right. Sporting goods retailer Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) reported fourth quarter results Tuesday morning that impressed investors, with shares rising 11% after the company offered a full-year earnings forecast well above expectations. And driving this profit forecast were inventories that are in ""great shape"" ahead of the company's busy spring season. ""As planned, we continued to address targeted inventory overages, and as a result our inventory is in great shape as we start 2023. We couldn't be more excited about our spring assortment,"" said Lauren Hobart, president and CEO. Dick's CFO Navdeep Gupta added on a call with analysts Tuesday morning, ""We were chasing inventory last year amidst industry-wide supply chain disruptions. ...Compared to Q4 of 2019, a 38% increase in sales was well ahead of our 29% increase in inventory. Our inventory is healthy and well positioned."" Looking at economy-wide data, we can see inventory-to-sales levels are still depressed relative to pre-pandemic levels. Though this measure is in part driven by strong sales, which keeps the ratio of inventories to sales low. Still, comments from Dick's were the latest echo of a refrain heard often from the industry as retail results have poured in over the last few weeks. And that refrain says the industry is finally finding something like a ""normal"" setting after three pandemic-altered years. Back in late February, Walmart (WMT) CEO Doug McMillon said his team, ""acted quickly and aggressively to address the inventory and cost challenges we faced last year."" ""We ended the quarter with inventory about flat to last year which is better than we anticipated and even better when you consider how inflation lifts that number,"" McMillon added on a call with analysts. ""And [we] did it while improving in-stock levels."" McMillon added: ""And so as we look at where we are today with much better position around inventory...I feel like this year will be more of a normal environment for markdowns or certainly more normal than what it was last year."" The company did, however, say there was ""work to be done"" on its apparel inventory levels. But clothing retailers Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN) both indicated in their latest reports inventory levels continue to improve. ""Despite an increasingly volatile macroeconomic climate, through the ongoing execution of our Polaris strategy, we remained agile, pivoted to meet customer demand and elevated our approach to inventory management,” said Jeff Gennette, Macy's chairman and CEO. ""In the fourth quarter, we benefited from our disciplined inventory approach."" The company reported inventory levels that were down 3% from last year and said, ""Inventory productivity continues to be a focus for the company in 2023 and beyond."" Nordstrom, for its part, said inventory levels were down 15% from last year and at levels similar to those that prevailed in 2019, the last year before the pandemic. ""We took decisive actions to right-size our inventory as we entered the new year, positioning us for greater agility amidst continuing macroeconomic uncertainty,"" said CEO Erik Nordstrom.

Tuesday's losses saw the S&P 500 fall by the most in two weeks and trade back below the key 4,000 level. The index also broke its 50-day moving average, an indicator traders closely watch for signs stocks are breaking from recent trends. ""Fed Chair Jerome Powell confirmed today that interest rates are set to rise higher than we previously anticipated,"" wrote Andrew Hunter, deputy chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. ""But with most evidence still pointing to economic weakness and markedly lower inflation this year, we still believe the Fed will begin cutting rates again sooner than markets are expecting."" Powell delivered the first of his two days of semi-annual testimony to Congress on Tuesday, speaking before the Senate Banking Committee ahead of Wednesday's appearance before the House Financial Services Committee. In his prepared testimony released Tuesday, Powell spoke of a sustained central bank campaign to rein in inflation. ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,"" Powell said. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes."" Answering questions from lawmakers, Powell said the full impacts of the Fed's interest rate increases haven't yet been felt in the economy. Markets have begun to price in at least two additional 0.25% rate hikes from the central bank over its next two meetings; investors began the year with optimism the Fed would stop its rate-hiking campaign as soon as February. Powell's comments Tuesday opened the door to the possibility of both a higher terminal federal funds rate, as well as a higher pace of increases. According to data from CME Group, Powell's comments spurred traders to price in a higher chance of a 0.50% hike than a 0.25% increase later this month. The Fed will kick off its next two-day policy meeting in two weeks, with a policy announcement set for the afternoon of March 22. Elsewhere in markets, WTI crude oil was under pressure, falling more than 3.7% to around $77.40 per barrel.

U.S. stocks were trading lower Tuesday as some analysts said the comments were more hawkish than expected. Near 2:20 p.m. ET, the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) was near session lows, falling 1.5%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) off 1.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) falling 1.2%. ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,"" Powell told the Senate Banking Committee in prepared remarks.

""Although inflation has been moderating in recent months, the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy,"" Powell added. The latest Consumer Price Index report released last month showed prices rose 6.4% over the prior year in January, a slowdown from last summer's peak inflation rate of 9.1% but still well above the Fed's 2% target. Powell's comments spurred traders to price in a higher chance of a 0.50% hike than a 0.25% increase later this month, according to data from CME Group. In a note, Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner said Powell’s remarks ""opened the door"" to a return of 0.50% hikes, ""If the incoming data flow warrants it."" If there are ""upside surprises"" in a jobs report this Friday from the Labor Department, that could ""drive a faster and longer tightening cycle,"" according to Zentner's note. The Fed projected at its December policy meeting interest rates would need to rise to a range of 5%-5.25% this year, though Powell's comments now suggest rates will need to eventually rise above this level. Following the Fed's February policy decision, the central bank's benchmark interest rate stands in a range of 4.5%-4.75%. Some Senate Democrats challenged Powell during Tuesday’s hearing, cautioning that his rate hikes could lead to job losses. Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown (D-OH) said there are other ways to bring down prices, citing the strengthening of supply chains, boosting of U.S. manufacturing and the rebuilding of infrastructure. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said if the central bank raises rates as much as planned, to 5%-5.25% excluding any further rate hikes Powell has now suggested above that level, unemployment would rise to 4.6%. That, she said, would cost two million people jobs. ""Chair Powell, if you could speak directly to the two million hardworking people who have decent jobs today, who you're planning to get fired over the next year, what would you say to them?"" Warren asked. Powell, in response, said: ""I would explain to people more broadly that inflation is extremely high and it's hurting the working people of this country badly. All of them, not just two million of them, but all of them are suffering under high inflation, and we are taking the only measures we have to bring inflation down."" In a hat tip to these concerns, Powell said in his prepared remarks that the Fed is ""acutely aware"" high inflation is causing ""significant hardship"" for Americans while also pledging to “stay the course until the job is done."" The Fed chair said Tuesday policymakers will continue to make decisions on a meeting by meeting basis. Powell noted that economic data from January on inflation, job growth, consumer spending, and manufacturing production have partly reversed course from the slowdown seen back in December. Powell attributed some of the softening to unseasonably warm weather in January, but cautioned that the ""breadth of the reversal"" suggests inflation is running higher than expected. He reiterated the Fed still needs to see a drop in services inflation excluding housing to bring inflation down, which is likely to require a weaker job market.

2023-03-07,aapl,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/heres-what-biden-wants-to-do-to-shore-up-medicare-135302609.html,"President Biden is set to formally release his 2024 budget proposal later this week and is already offering previews on what he plans to do with Medicare. In new details released Tuesday to keep the program afloat into the 2050s, Biden says he can extend the solvency of the program without any benefit cuts via three moves: an increase on the tax rate on both earned and unearned income above $400,000; the closing of loopholes that shields some “pass-through” income from Medicare taxes; and allowing Medicare to negotiate on a wider array of prescription drugs. And overall, the president is looking at least five different tax changes for wealthy Americans and corporations to pay for his myriad ideas — both for Medicare and his larger push to “invest in America” and pay down the deficit. And while the proposal isn’t likely to get a vote on Capitol Hill, it will serve as an important marker of Biden’s priorities. The early focus on Medicare — as well as Social Security — underlines just how “deeply embedded” the twin programs have become in Biden’s political identity, Alex Lawson, the executive director of a group called Social Security Works, recently noted in an interview. The president talks nearly every week about the program and also released a New York Times op-ed on the topic Tuesday morning. Defending the programs now “seems to be one of the defining characteristics of Biden-world,” Lawson added. What the White House appears to be doing with this week’s choreographed multi-day rollout — culminating in a formal unveiling on Thursday in Philadelphia — is an attempt to shape the conversation as both the debt ceiling fight heats up this summer and a likely Biden 2024 re-election campaign kicks off. In the op-ed released Tuesday morning, President Biden wrote that “Medicare is more than a government program. It’s the rock-solid guarantee that Americans have counted on to be there for them when they retire."" The issue is top of mind with a key Medicare trust fund likely to run low on funds as early as 2028, according to a recent government trustees report. Meanwhile, Social Security likely has the funds to continue paying out current benefits for only a few years longer, through 2034. Biden’s proposal would increase the Medicare tax rate from 3.8% to 5% on all income above $400,000. It would also target what is known as net investment income - an additional fee on the returns for high-income earners as well as “pass through” business for Americans above $400,000 per year. The White House aims to change the rules and close loopholes around that income, which it notes can be shielded from the taxes that fund the Medicare program because it is classified currently as “neither earned income nor investment income.” The proposal would close loopholes in that area and also change the government's rules to allow that money to be sent to Medicare’s crucial Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, President of the American Action Forum, noted in a Yahoo Finance Live interview on Tuesday that the net investment tax piece is ""really using a tool that has never been used in Medicare before [and] it's not a particularly good piece of tax policy."" Holtz-Eakin, a Republican and former director of the Congressional Budget Office, added that the way to get these programs under control fiscally is to control growth, and ""you can't tax your way out of this."" The budget will also propose savings via new prescription drug reforms by giving Medicare the authority to negotiate prices for additional higher-cost drugs. The White House estimates these changes will save $200 billion over the coming decade. “There are ways in which the program can be operated more efficiently,” said Paul Van de Water, a Medicare specialist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who also listed other options for the years ahead like lowering payment rates to healthcare providers and limiting payments to Medicare Advantage. But even with all that, “it's still going to be essential we think to raise additional revenues,” he said. Van de Water also noted that Biden has previously proposed changes to the net investment income tax during a previous budget proposal. Thursday’s release will be Biden’s third since taking office. Tuesday’s unveiling is just the first step in what is much more detail to come about Biden's ideas and how he’ll pay for it all. In a recent online video, Biden’s budget director, Shalanda Young, outlined the overall priorities, including expanding the economy, lowering costs, protecting Social Security and Medicare as well as reducing the deficit by $2 trillion over the coming decade. So what other tax increases could be proposed? Administration officials say that both wealthy Americans and corporations will be the focus. In his State of the Union, Biden called to quadruple the excise tax on stock buybacks and to institute a new ""billionaire minimum tax"" on wealth. Both appear set for repeat appearances on Thursday. The president could also call to raise the top corporate tax rate, which would come in addition to a corporate minimum tax instituted last year as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. While House Republicans have pledged that all tax increases are off the table and won't be considered in the House. But the move will increase the pressure on Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) to release his own plan, something he has promised is coming soon. What Speaker McCarthy has discussed in the past is creating the “path” to balance the budget. House Republicans have already floated some small-scale proposals — targeting things like Medicaid and what they term as “woke waste.” What’s unclear — and Democrats and some budget experts charge is impossible — is how that plan takes a significant bite out of the deficit if Social Security, Medicare, and tax increases are all off the table. “We’re not going to sit here and be lectured by those folks about fiscal responsibility,” Biden said recently in a preview of the likely debate to come, adding of the GOP, it will “be interesting to see what they want to cut and what their numbers add up to.” This post has been updated.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. When Fed Chair Jay Powell settles in for his semi-annual testimony to the Senate Banking Committee today, investors will be looking for confirmation that the central bank is going to keep raising interest rates for the next several meetings to fight inflation. Besides the ongoing debate about whether the Fed’s actions are going to send the U.S. economy into recession and stocks into a tailspin, there’s been one other important side effect: the bond market is the hottest it’s been in years. That’s newly true not just for institutional investors, but for retail traders as well. That’s because online trading of Treasuries is accessible at a critical mass for the first time with rates at these levels. It's never been easier to buy, be it directly via the Treasury Department, from the discount brokerages, or through ETFs. The repricing of rate expectations this year has sent yields on many Treasury notes and bonds to their highest in 15 years, with the 2-year, 10-year (TNX), and 30-year all yielding around 4%. It’s been a huge shift for fixed income. Besides institutional investors salivating over government and corporate debt, retail traders are so keen they've repeatedly crashed the TreasuryDirect website, which provides a conduit to Treasuries and I bonds. (The latter is an inflation-protected instrument that has both a fixed rate and one that changes with inflation). “For pretty much the entire decade, leading up to this year, when people asked about retail and fixed income, I could just simply say, ‘no one really cares.’ The past year, that has significantly changed,” Shawn Cruz, Head Trading Strategist at TD Ameritrade, told Yahoo Finance. Sales of Treasury bills – those with maturities of one year or less – through TreasuryDirect were $12.0 billion in January, a record. Before last August, that number hadn’t cracked $5 billion. Net sales of I bonds were $4.2 billion in January, after spiking to $6.8 billion last October. Salim Ramji, Global Head of iShares and Index Investments at BlackRock, was enthusiastic about fixed income when he recently spoke to Yahoo Finance: “It’s a great time for investors to look for yield, but they don’t have to take the kind of risk that they might have two, three, four years ago, because you can get 4% yields in Treasuries. You can get 5% yields in investment grade, even at the front end.” BlackRock, as the largest provider of ETFs by assets, has benefited from the boom. Thus far in 2023, investors have poured $9.9 billion into U.S. iShares fixed income ETFs. And not all investors are going long; the firm’s most popular instrument in February in the category was the iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF (SHV). How long will the party last? Even if the Fed raises interest rates at its next three meetings, some strategists have called for a longer period of higher inflation and higher interest rates, an end to the so-called “Great Moderation.”  BlackRock predicts that fixed income ETF assets under management will reach $5 trillion by 2030. As Ramji said, “Having rates as low as they were for as long as they were was kind of the aberration. I think we’re resetting back now to a much more normal fixed income environment, and the great thing for investors, as a result, is they can use it to generate income, and so for retirees or people looking at their wealth portfolios, they’re able to generate good, long-term income from long-term investments like Treasuries or investment grade.” In other words, for a lot of retail investors right now, boring is beautiful. - Economy Wholesale Inventories, January Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before Senate Banking Committee Earnings Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS); Casey's General (CASY); CrowdStrike (CRWD); Manchester United (MANU); Sea Limited (SE); Stitch Fix (SFIX); Thor Industries (THO) Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"
2023-03-06,aapl,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-march-6-2023-123642397.html,"U.S. stocks lost steam Monday afternoon after rallying earlier in the session, kicking off a busy week on Wall Street with a mixed tone. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended the session near the flatline, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) increased 0.1%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) edged down 0.1%, reversing its gains from earlier in the trading session. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note hovered near 4% Monday afternoon, before settling at 3.98%. Crude oil traded higher, with U.S. benchmark WTI up at $80.55 a barrel. The dollar index moved lower trading at $104.34. U.S. stocks gained on Friday to close out a volatile week, while bond yields pulled back from their recent highs. The three major indexes rose for the week, with the Dow Jones adding 1.7%, the S&P 500 closing 1.9% higher, and the Nasdaq gaining 2.6%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury settled back below the key 4% level, and the two-year yield fell to 4.86%. Economic data released on Friday showed the services sector grew in February. This week, Wall Street will be paying close attention to the monthly jobs report out Friday. The February jobs report is expected to show 215,000 new jobs have been added to the economy, according to economist estimates, a slower pace from January’s blowout number of 517,000 job additions. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.4%. Another key point from the report will be wage growth, with a 0.3% month-to-month bump in average hourly earnings anticipated and 4.7% over the last year. Economists at Bank of America, led by Michael Gapen, believe a deceleration from January will be tied largely to weather shifts and a general mean-reverting nature of payrolls. ""Typically, when payroll growth records a sizable increase or decrease, we see a reversal in the following month,"" the firm noted. Also, investors will be keeping an eye on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's two-day biannual monetary policy testimony on Capitol Hill, which begins Tuesday. Other highlights this week include ADP’s monthly read on private payroll growth, January’s report on job openings from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Fed’s Beige Book. In single stock moves, Apple (AAPL) shares gained nearly 2% on Monday as Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng initiated coverage of Apple with a buy rating and a price target of $199. Ng noted Apple's success in hardware design and brand loyalty has led to a growing installed base of users that provide visibility into revenue growth. And Apple's valuation is attractive relative to its historical multiple and to peers. Ciena (CIEN) shares jumped 4% Monday after the company posted better than expected results that topped analysts expectations amid strong demand in its networking platforms business. Shares of BridgeBio Pharma (BBIO) surged more than 50% after the company topped Wall Street's expectations in a study of children with achondroplasia, a genetic condition that slows bone growth. Snap (SNAP) shares climbed 9% amid growing chatter that the U.S. could restrict — or ban — use of the TikTok app. Spirit Airlines (SAVE) shares tanked nearly 9% following reports that JetBlue Airways (JBLU) is bracing for turbulence from the Justice Department as it tries to block the airline's planned takeover of Spirit Airlines in the coming days, The Wall Street Journal reported. JetBlue shares finished up about 1%. On the earnings front, Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Oracle (ORCL) and BJ's Wholesale (BJ) are set to report results this week. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-06,aapl,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/as-airbnb-wins-back-wall-street-some-hosts-see-saturation-130755035.html,"Airbnb (ABNB) dazzled Wall Street with better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings results and forward guidance on February 14. ""We believe ADR [average daily rate] was the key upside surprise relative to investor expectations,"" Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni wrote about the company's Q1 guidance in a research note, ""which should help support more optimism around further upside on pricing and margin in the remaining three quarters [of 2023]."" Investors cheered the company's quarter by sending shares up 13% on February 15, the stock's biggest one-day increase since Airbnb's December 2020 IPO. On February 16, the stock logged its highest close since May 2022. Even after giving back some post-earnings gains, Airbnb stock is up about 45% from a record low reached at the end of 2022. But the sentiment shift came as something of a surprise to hosts and managers using the home-booking platform who say they are finding it harder and harder to book guests. Ric Kenworthy, who manages 96 short-rental property listings through a company, Old Town Rental, in Arizona, was scrambling to fill unbooked units ahead of last month's Super Bowl in Glendale. ""We ended up at, let's just assume midday Saturday before the Super Bowl, close to 90% booked for all of our properties,"" Kenworthy told Yahoo Finance, later adding: ""Some key markets are experiencing quite a bit of saturation."" Kenworthy said he ended up cutting his listing prices by 50%: The going-rate for one of his rental properties went for $450-$600 a night that weekend after he'd been anticipating a rate closer to $1,000 a night given the demand generally created by an event like the Super Bowl. ""In 2022, we saw new heights in demand on the Airbnb platform and the result is continued growth in typical Host income, which was over $14,000 in the US,"" Sam Randall, a representative for Airbnb, told Yahoo Finance in a statement. ""We continue to invest in the success of our Host community and in the coming months will release new pricing tools to help them set competitive prices."" While some Airbnb hosts may not be feeling the full benefits, there is little doubt travel demand is back in full swing. Despite sticky inflation, consumers are booking trips: Data from a Bank of America Institute survey shows money spent on airline travel per household jumped 3.5% in January while international spending also increased compared to two years ago. ""I think the psychological impact of being locked down for some portion of the pandemic has only accelerated the trend that had already started,"" Marriott International (MAR) CEO Anthony Capuano told Yahoo Finance Live after the company's fourth-quarter earnings results showed the average room rates up 13% and revenue earned per average room jumping 29% year over year. Airbnb posted revenue of $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter, better than analyst expectations for revenues of $1.86 billion. The company's earnings per share also topped estimates, coming in at $0.48 cents against $0.08 forecasted. On the company's earnings call, CEO Brian Chesky told analysts Airbnb experienced ""tremendous growth"" in units listed online, ending 2022 with 6.6 million active listings. That was 16% higher compared to the previous year. Chesky attributed the increase in supply to two factors: demand and systematic improvements to their platform. As people flocked back to traveling, nights and experiences booked increased 20% in the fourth quarter, with active bookers in the fourth quarter reaching a record for the company. ""[Annual] revenue of $8.4 billion grew 40% year-over-year,"" Chesky said on the earnings call. ""And when you exclude foreign exchange, our revenue increased by 46% year-over-year."" The average daily rate for an Airbnb accommodation grew 36% compared to 2019 levels, according to CFO David Stephenson. He noted that it's generally ""more expensive"" to stay at an Airbnb than other accommodations and projected rates would come down ""modestly"" through the end of this year. ""We're not seeing any major shifts in overall kind of utilization rate that give us any concern,"" Stephenson said. ""We feel like we continue to keep, in aggregate, this nice balance of growing supply and growing demand, and we want to keep that relative balance."" Airbnb also stressed that the company is focused on three strategic priorities: raising awareness of hosting, upgrading core services, and scaling services beyond its core offerings. In late 2022, Airbnb added short-term sublet listings in an effort to grow its footprint among the multifamily market. The company asserted landlords and property managers using the sublet service could earn about 20% of the booking revenue. Airbnb also rolled out new categories, including one called ""OMG,"" which captures the most unique and exclusive accommodations. And after a Wall Street Journal report highlighted how some travelers were frustrated with host-mandated chore lists and the app's pricing format leading to sneaky costs, Airbnb launched a feature to show users price totals that include cleaning, service, and other fees. Looking ahead, some wonder about the sustainability of Airbnb's boom. “Can the top line demand persist? And then given their growth and supply, can the average rates [hold]?,” Nick Jones, research analyst at JMP Securities, told Yahoo Finance. ""If the demand wanes, that's going to increase available supply at any given day, which then... should result in lower prices, which then would impact their profitability."" Even if demand plateaus, the situation could change: January data from AirDNA suggested that rapid listing growth ""outpaced rising demand"" in 2022. ""U.S. short-term rentals earned over $62 billion ($141 billion globally) throughout the year (up 25.1% YoY), with almost 200 million nights stayed and over two million listings receiving at least one booking,"" AirDNA stated. ""Overall occupancy ended the year at 58.7%, a significant drop from the 61.3% in 2021."" In any case, as travel evolves after the pandemic bust and boom, some Airbnb hosts see a shift in consumer behavior. Michelle Burson, owner of a 4,000 square-foot Airbnb in Brookings, Oregon, is experiencing less foot traffic for her rental unit. ""Our bookings [have] declined last year compared to the previous year,"" Burson said. In Burson's view, ""one of the reasons was people were taking their traditional vacations…going to Hawaii, Europe, rather than driving, [or taking] road trips."" And Masha Löfstedt, who owns three rental properties in Oregon, struggled to get her property booked ahead of the holiday season. ""One of our houses that rents out all the time, nobody's booked for this weekend. That's like the first time in years,"" Löfstedt told Yahoo Finance in late 2022.

While I really enjoyed watching Salesforce and C3.ai shares explode higher post earnings last week, hot movers along these lines have been too few and far between (in either direction) in recent weeks. But if you take a step back and level set the stock market today, the muted action kind of makes a great deal of sense. Investors are facing a fresh dilemma — call it paralysis by analysis amid all the incoming data flying in. On the one hand, we have hot retail sales and inflation reports from the government — both calling into question whether the Federal Reserve is moving fast enough to squash inflation. On the other end of the spectrum, the jobs market continues to be solid (as probably seen in this week's jobs report). Yet, when you look at fourth quarter earnings (and conference calls) from Best Buy, Home Depot, Target and other retailers, you will see consumer weakness in big ticket merchandise. Dig into Target's earnings, and you will see a shopper trading down to cheaper private label goods because they are less inflationary and they just got laid off by a tech company. Taken together, this is a confusing time to be an investor – something market maven Keith Lerner at Truist captures in a new note he sent me: ""The recent action is very much aligned with a key market dilemma we have been highlighting: If the economy stays stronger, as we have seen recently, Fed policy is set to remain tighter, and this will weigh on market valuations. Or, instead, if the economy weakens, this will pressure profits. Neither of these outcomes are favorable for premium market valuations."" In other words, Mr. Market doesn't know what he wants! And if you think all the bad news of any kind is priced into stocks, Lerner adds these considerations: ""For perspective, the S&P 500’s forward P/E of 17.6x is still slightly above the 10-year average of 17.2x, and that’s in the context of a high degree of uncertainty around economic growth, inflation, and earnings. Forward earnings estimates are hovering near a 52- week low, and downside risks remain. The 1-year U.S. Treasury yield has jumped above 5% for the first time since 2007, and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which is hovering around 4%, is nearly double the average of the past decade.""

2023-03-04,aapl,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/bankman-fried-flip-phone-limited-153437236.html,"By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sam Bankman-Fried should be allowed while on bail to have a flip phone with no internet capability and a basic laptop with limited functions, but be forbidden from using other electronic communication devices, the U.S. Department of Justice said. The proposal to limit the indicted FTX cryptocurrency exchange founder's communications was filed late on Friday in Manhattan federal court, on behalf of the government and Bankman-Fried's defense team. It requires approval by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who oversees the case. Kaplan had signaled at a Feb. 16 hearing that he might jail the 30-year-old Bankman-Fried for testing the limits of his $250 million bail package by communicating in ways that could not be monitored. The judge said he did not want to set Bankman-Fried ""loose in this garden of electronic devices,"" following accusations that Bankman-Fried tried to contact possible government witnesses and used a virtual private network to watch football. Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty after prosecutors said he stole billions of dollars of FTX customer funds to plug losses at his Alameda Research hedge fund. He faces 12 criminal charges under an indictment made public on Feb. 23. The proposed flip phone or other non-smartphone for Bankman-Fried would be limited to voice calls and SMS text messages. Laptop internet use would be restricted to specified virtual private networks, 23 websites for personal use including news, sports and food delivery, and websites to help Bankman-Fried prepare for his scheduled Oct. 2 trial. Bankman-Fried is living under house arrest with his parents, both Stanford Law School professors, in Palo Alto, California. The parents agreed to submit sworn affidavits that they would not bring other electronic devices into their home or let their son use theirs. They also agreed that each device would carry software that periodically takes videos or photos of the user, which court officers would be allowed to review, the letter said. Bankman-Fried's lawyers did not immediately respond on Saturday to requests for comment. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York and Anirudh Saligrama in Bengaluru; Editing by Daniel Wallis)"

At the close, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) surged 1.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) increased 1.1%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 2%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note (^TNX) moved back and forth around the key 4% level Friday, eventually settling below the line, after services data showed economic activity expanded in February. Crude oil traded higher, with U.S. benchmark WTI (CL=F) up at $79.71 a barrel. On the economic data side, economic activity in the services sector grew in February for the second consecutive month as the ISM Services PMI came in at 55.1, slightly lower from 55.2 recorded in January and above economist expectations of 54.5. February's ISM Services figures ""suggests activity continues to expand at a reasonably healthy pace, but provides further reason to doubt the idea that there has been a resurgence in growth since the start of the year,"" Andrew Hunter, deputy chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note following the release. The moves come after the Federal Reserve published a semiannual Monetary Policy Report to Congress that details the central bank's plans to hike interest rates as a means to restore price stability. Officials indicated ""that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2% over time,"" the Fed said in its report. Stocks rallied on Thursday, with the S&P 500 trading lower for most of the session before rallying after commentary from Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic. Bostic said he’s still open to raising rates by another quarter percentage point at the central bank’s March meeting. “I let the data guide me,” Bostic told reporters in a press briefing. “If the data continue to come in suggesting the economy is stronger than I had projected, I’ll adjust my policy trajectory.” Bostic, who isn’t a voter on monetary policy this year, wrote an essay on Wednesday calling for the Fed to raise its policy rate by 50 basis points to a range of 5%-5.25% and then keep it there until well into 2024. Fed officials raised the benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point in February, pulling the target to stand in a range of 4.5%-4.75%. Policymakers will be releasing new projections after the central bank’s March 21-22 meeting. In single stock moves, C3.ai (AI) shares surged over 30% Friday after the company posted fiscal third quarter revenue that came at $66.7 million, beating analyst expectations of $64.2 million. Shares of Rivian (RIVN) jumped after the EV maker said on Friday it's keeping to the original production forecast of 50,000 vehicles in 2023. Costco (COST) shares sank 2% after the bulk retailer posted mixed results for the second quarter. Total revenue for its latest quarter was $55.27 billion, slightly below analysts' expectations of $55.58 billion. During the earnings call, the company provided some hopeful news on the inflation front. ChargePoint (CHPT) shares were down Friday after the maker of EV charging stations reported disappointing results and issued softer guidance. Shares of Amazon (AMZN) were up 3% as the company pauses construction on its second quarters in Arlington, Virginia. The move follows the tech giant's announcements of job cuts in the wake of slowing consumer and corporate spending. Marvell Technology (MRVL) stock fell after the company reported mixed results, with earnings in line with expectations but guidance weaker than forecasted. Shares of Meta Platforms (META) surged 6% as the company announced it would slash prices of its Quest Pro virtual-reality headset after the product launch. In the cryptocurrency market, both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) fell as customers pull their funds from crypto bank Silvergate (SI), whose stock plunged more than 57% during the trading session on Thursday. Following the drop in Bitcoin, the pullback is close to 10% and the digital asset was on pace to close below its 50-day moving average for the first time in almost two months, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-02,aapl,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-today-march-2-2023-135533324.html,"Stocks rallied on Thursday with the Dow leading markets higher as results from Salesforce (CRM) lifted the index, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq shook off early losses to finish in the green. At the close on Thursday, the S&P 500 was up 0.76%, the Nasdaq higher by 0.73%, and the blue chip Dow up 1.05%. Rates remained a key focus for investors, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note settling north of 4%, its highest level since November. The rise in yields has come as investors brace for more aggressive action from the Federal Reserve in the coming months as inflation stays elevated and the economy remains strong. On the front end of the Treasury curve, the yield on 2-year notes continued to trade near its highest level since 2007. The 2-year yield, which stood near 4.8% on Thursday, is seen as the best proxy for investor expectations of the Fed's near-term path for interest rates. In single-stock moves, shares of Salesforce rose 11.5% on Thursday as investors cheered the company's latest quarterly report, which saw the embattled Dow member double down on cost-cutting initiatives and shareholder return plans. The stock's opening gap higher of 16% was its largest since Aug. 2020, according to data from Bloomberg. In an interview with Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi late Wednesday, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in reference to the company's efficiency initiatives: ""We have hit the hyper-space button."" The company announced in its quarterly report an increase in its share repurchase authorization to $20 billion, with COO Brian Millham telling investors on a call, ""We're inspecting every part of our business to find opportunities to drive efficiencies and reduce cost of sales, marketing, and G&A."" Salesforce's 11.5% jump, good for jsut over a $19 per share increase in the stock price, added roughly 110 points to the price-weighted Dow's 340 point gain on Thursday. Elsewhere in single-stock moves, shares of troubled bank Silvergate (SI) fell 57% on Thursday after the company delayed the filing of its annual report and said it would likely report losses larger than those previously disclosed. The bank took on several high-profile crypto clients in recent years and has seen its share price collapse by more than 90% in the wake of the failure of FTX, among other crypto bankruptcies. Tesla (TSLA) shares were also in focus on Thursday, falling 5.9% as the electric carmaker held its latest investor day on Wednesday, which revealed few new product details but emphasized the company's push to unlock new efficiencies in its manufacturing and design processes. On the economic data side, the weekly report on initial jobless claims showed 190,000 new filings for unemployment insurance were made last week, the latest sign the labor market remains robust. Though tomorrow marks the first Friday of the month, the February jobs report will not be released until March 10.

2023-03-02,aapl,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/mortgage-rates-surge-closer-to-7-170022384.html,"Mortgage rates jumped higher this week, getting even closer to 7% and crushing homebuyer activity, which hit a 28-year low. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage increased to 6.65% from 6.50% the week prior, according to Freddie Mac. Rates have climbed over a half-point in February, reversing declines since mid-November. The spike in rates is another blow to would-be buyers, who are also facing still-high home prices and a shortage of affordable homes for sale. Sellers also appear to be pulling their listings, rather than cutting prices further to spur interest. “I think the biggest concern is buying into a market that would continue to go down,” Jeff Reynolds, broker at Compass and founder of UrbanCondoSpaces, recently told Yahoo Finance. “In my 18-year career, I have never seen rate moves like we are seeing now.” The volume of applications to purchase a home slid by 6% from one week earlier, the Mortgage Bankers Association’s survey of applications for the week ending Feb. 24 found. Overall, demand was 44% lower than the same week a year ago and has nosedived to a 28-year low. The drop in demand registered this past month is a sign that affordability remains a top concern, according to Redfin Deputy Chief Economist Taylor Marr. “The housing market took two steps forward in December and January, but has taken one step back in February,” Marr said in a statement. “Mortgage rates crept back this month, which is prompting more buyers and sellers to back off.” Another reason for the pullback in demand is rising home prices. The national median list price increased to $415,000 in February, Realtor.com data showed, up from $406,000 in January. While that’s down 7.6% from June’s peak of $449,000 – it still represents a yearly growth rate of 7.8%. That translates to out-of-pocket costs for buyers. According to Realtor.com, the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home is roughly $630 higher than a year ago. That puts the monthly mortgage payment 45.1% higher than a year ago, exceeding rent growth, up 2.9% from a year ago, and inflation, up 6.4%. As rates continue to climb, fewer home sellers are active this year. The number of newly-listed homes for sale declined by 15.9% in February compared with the previous year, Realtor.com data found. That’s a larger rate of decline versus January’s 10.4% decrease, but a small improvement from November and December. Overall, new listings remained 27% below pre-pandemic 2017 to 2019 levels. According to Redfin, existing homeowners don’t want to move because they don’t want to give up their ultra-low mortgage rates. As of February, approximately 85% of mortgage holders have a rate far below 6%. Homeowners may also be hesitant to put their homes on the market due to soft homebuyer demand that’s forcing sellers to cut prices. “We'll find out in the next 30 days if buyers are getting used to higher rates,” Reynolds said, “or if they will stay on the sideline waiting for rates to come back to earth.” Gabriella is a personal finance reporter at Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-02,aapl,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/what-the-end-of-the-great-moderation-era-means-for-investors-morning-brief-103057491.html,"This article first appeared in the Morning Brief. Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET. Subscribe Thursday, March 2, 2023 Today's newsletter is by Jared Blikre, a reporter focused on the markets on Yahoo Finance. Follow him on Twitter @SPYJared. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. In 2004, then-Fed chair Ben Bernanke gave a speech titled, ""The Great Moderation."" His thesis: ""One of the most striking features of the economic landscape over the past twenty years or so has been a substantial decline in macroeconomic volatility."" And while the Global Financial Crisis dented this belief, a post-crisis economic recovery and stock market boom brought these ideas back into vogue among many investors who rode a ""stocks only go up"" rally for more than a decade. But with inflation at multi-decade highs and interest rates at their highest levels in over 15 years, some investors are saying that the old investing epoch has come to an end — ushering in a new era where fundamentals matter, traditional savers are rewarded once again, and the volatility that Bernanke said goodbye to is back. In other words, choppier waters might be the new norm for a while. There are a few things that are starkly different about this present business cycle, Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, told Yahoo Finance Live Wednesday. First, there's the hot labor market, despite the white-collar layoffs. Historically, it's the lower-wage workers that are first in line to get cut. ""Yet another thing about this cycle that is just so different relative to past cycles,"" Saunders said. To date, this downturn has been felt mostly at the upper ends of the wealth spectrum, with asset prices like stocks, bonds, and real estate suffering declines. Meanwhile, inflation is a pernicious problem that disproportionately affects lower incomes. But it has not yet become entrenched — at least in the eyes of policy makers. Investors may not know what to think, but Sonders expects the current fog to lift a bit when we get the next batch of quarterly reports in April. But it might not be a clarity worth celebrating. Analysts have already been lowering the bar for the first quarter earnings, and Sonders believes they have a ways to go considering the bond market is signaling the Fed needs to be yet more aggressive. ""One of the factors most highly correlated to corporate earnings is the 10-year [U.S. Treasury] yield, with a lag,"" she says. Sonders believes the 10-year yield is forecasting the Fed will need to keep rates higher for longer, and that ""the path of least resistance for [earnings estimates] is down"" — targeting the first half of this year. Whether or not that near-term pain materializes, Sonders closes the door on the prior epoch of declining rates and volatility, then describes what investors can expect in the years to come. ""I think that the end of the Great Moderation era is very much here ... Gone are the days of cheap access to goods, cheap access to energy, [and] cheap access to labor. I think all three of those ships have sailed,"" she says. Sonders argues that reversing the engine of globalization and reorienting toward regionalism will have profound investing implications over the secular time frame. ""I would therefore expect greater inflation volatility, economic volatility, [and] geopolitical volatility. We're in this era of regionalization and demographic shifts that are pretty painful."" But as painful as these changes are for workers, consumers and investors alike, there are opportunities for investors. Consider that the Fed has finally raised short-term rates — the so-called risk-free rate — to levels that prevailed in decades prior. ""With the return of the risk-free [Treasury] rate, it's brought secular changes, including the fact that fundamentals are reattaching to prices,"" says Sonders. She goes on to explain that the market is no longer skewed so heavily toward mega cap stocks, and that there's hope for stock pickers once again after over a decade of underperformance. ""This has important implications and helps explain why equal-weighted [stock indices] have generally been doing better than [market] cap-weighted [indices] — why active [investing] has been doing better than passive [investing] — or at least is on a more level playing field with passive. And I think those are secular and as important backdrops for investors to think about.""

2023-03-02,aapl,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/silvergate-stock-crashes-after-company-delays-annual-report-reveals-new-losses-121923800.html,"Shares of troubled lender Silvergate (SI) fell 57% on Thursday after the company said late Wednesday it will miss a March 16 deadline to file its already-delayed annual report. The bank said its team ""requires additional time to perform analysis, record journal entries related to subsequent events and to complete management’s evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting."" ""The Company is currently analyzing certain regulatory and other inquiries and investigations that are pending with respect to the Company,"" the company added. Silvergate shares have collapsed over the last year as the company's entanglements with several crypto firms — including bankrupt exchange FTX, among others — resulted in deposits falling by more than two-thirds in the fourth quarter of last year. In January, the company laid off 40% of its staff. The company later suspended a dividend paid on preferred shares as it sought to shore up cash. Over the last year, shares of the bank have lost more than 95%. A spokesperson for Silvergate told Yahoo Finance: ""Silvergate is working diligently to file its 10-K as soon as possible and has no further comment at this time."" In Wednesday's notice, the bank said it sold additional debt securities beyond what was previously anticipated in January and February and it expects to record further losses than what was previously disclosed. In January, the company disclosed it took $887 million worth of non-interest losses in the fourth quarter. The sales are primarily to repay ""outstanding advances"" it received from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, Silvergate said. The bank also needs additional time to complete an ""evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting"" being conducted by its third party accounting firm. Citing business and regulatory challenges, the company is weighing how much the changes might affect its ""ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements,"" according to the filing. In late January, a bi-partisan group of U.S. Senators pressed the company to provide answers over whether it was aware its clients FTX misused customer funds. A Reuters report in February said a Silvergate account controlled by Binance.US moved millions of dollars to a company controlled by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. Last week in a joint statement with the Federal Deposit and Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve made a point to highlight the heightened liquidity risks for banks taking on crypto-related clients. As for its own risks, Silvergate cited “heightened regulatory scrutiny of banking institutions that provide products and services to the digital asset industry,"" private litigation, and investigations from congressional inquiries, banking regulators and the Justice Department. Analysts at JPMorgan downgraded the stock to Underweight from Neutral and withdrew their its price target in a note out Thursday, calling the situation ""highly unusual"" and adding: ""The 'run' experienced at Silvergate appears to have been driven by a combination of (1) trust in the overall system being shaken given the collapse of previously trusted players (such as FTX) and (2) short-sellers voicing concerns (primarily on Twitter).""

2023-03-01,aapl,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-march-1-2023-124448484.html,"U.S. stocks finished mostly lower Wednesday to start March as key manufacturing data offered mixed results and two Federal Reserve officials suggested a more aggressive rate-hiking campaign in the coming months. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) declined by 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was flat. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell by 0.6%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note moved upward and briefly touched 4% Wednesday. Crude oil traded higher, with U.S. benchmark WTI up at $77.73 a barrel. On the economic data side, U.S. manufacturing firms signaled a grim outlook for the sector, according to the latest PMI data from S&P Global. The seasonally adjusted S&P Global US Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index was revised lower to 47.3 in February, up from 46.9 in January. The reading indicates ""a solid deterioration in the health of the goods-producing sector, despite the pace of decline softening to the slowest for three months."" Separately, economic activity in the manufacturing sector diminished in February for the fourth consecutive month following a 28-month period of growth, according to the Institute for Supply Management report on business. The data offered a mixed bag. Employment in manufacturing decreased to 49.10 in February from 50.60 in January. New orders rose to 47.0 compared to January's figure of 42.5. Prices paid jumped to 51.3 from January's reading of 44.5. Stocks fell Tuesday, rounding out the last day of a volatile month of February on Wall Street. According to JP Morgan’s trading desk, February’s month-end rebalance drove some weakness in equities and strength in bonds Tuesday afternoon. With February in the rearview, the S&P 500 remains up more than 3% this year, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group. Mega-caps have been a massive driver of the index moves. That said, 20 of the largest stocks in the S&P 500 have accounted for most of the index’s gains. Now, as the calendar turns, March historically sees the S&P 500’s gains in the second half of the month, Bespoke Investment Group noted. The path of the Federal Reserve's rate hikes remains in focus for investors. Two Federal Reserve officials spoke on Wednesday leaned in the move that aggressive interest rate hikes are the path forward to ease inflation. They followed Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, who said on Tuesday it would be a “danger and a mistake for policy makers to rely too heavily on market reactions” and emphasized the importance to “supplement these traditional data with observations on the ground from the real economy.” However, Goolsbee, who will be a voter at this year’s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting, didn’t comment on monetary policy. Since last year, the Fed has sharply raised rates in an effort to cool inflation. But inflation remains sticky. Policymakers will be releasing new projections after the central bank’s March 21-22 meeting. On the housing front, mortgage rates continue to move upward, pushing buyers to the sidelines as the spring housing market is underway. Both purchase and refinance applications slumped last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index. Volume of purchase applications hit a 28-year low, down 44% from a year ago. Here are some of the tickers trending on Yahoo Finance today:  Eli Lilly and Company (LLY): The drugmaker announced Wednesday morning it expects to cap out-of-pocket cost of its insulin at $35 a month. The plan comes as a promise to provide critical relief to some people with diabetes, who at times face higher medical costs. Kohl's (KSS): Shares of the retail giant declined nearly 2% Wednesday after the company posted a surprise fourth-quarter loss and sales slumped as consumer habits shift away from discretionary spending. Wendy's (WEN): The fast-food chain announced in its quarterly earnings about its plans to target sales growth through 2025 as it streamlines costs. Rivian (RIVN): The electric truck manufacturer’s guidance for fiscal 2023 deliveries came in 20% below estimates as the EV maker struggles to scale up its truck, van, and SUV production. Nio (NIO): Another EV maker gave weak revenue guidance. The Chinese premium EV startup, reported a much worse-than-expected fourth-quarter loss as margins took a hit due to in part to ""losses on purchase commitments."" Novavax (NVAX): The vaccine maker warned of its ability to stay in business through next year. This comes as the company has struggled to develop and enter the COVID-19 vaccine market. Alibaba (BABA): The stock climbed in the wake of the group’s quarterly earnings, and fueled by the 4% surge in the Hang Seng index overnight. Dollar Tree (DLTR): The discount retailer stock rose nearly 2% after the company posted weaker guidance for the current fiscal year. Tesla (TSLA): The EV maker is set to kickoff its first Investor Day event on Wednesday from its gigafactory in Austin, Texas. CEO Elon Musk is expected to announce new Tesla products that aim to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and lead to a ""fully sustainable energy future."" HP (HPQ): The PC and printing giant's stock wavered after the company posted mix results amid a soft demand environment for personal computers. Fiscal-quarter sales dropped 18% year-over-year. Printer sales sank 5% from a year ago. Reata Pharmaceuticals (RETA): The stock surged nearly 200% Wednesday after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved the company's treatment for Friedreich’s ataxia, a rare inherited disease that causes damage to the nervous system. Lowe's (LOW): The home-improvement company reported weaker fiscal sales in the fourth quarter and issued a conservative outlook ahead, with comparable sales expected to be flat to down 2% compared to the prior year.

2023-03-01,aapl,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/goldman-sachs-tries-to-reset-firm-culture-after-three-unusual-years-171038235.html,"Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon addressed negative headlines surrounding the bank's culture during the company's second-ever investor day on Tuesday. ""I hate the noise,"" Solomon said bluntly. ""I live in the same neighborhood as you all live in and I wish the noise was different."" Various media reports of mass partner exits, coupled with recent Wall Street chatter the bank has lost its way after the failure of its consumer banking project Marcus, have all contributed to unfavorable sentiment. And this coming after the company laid off some 3,200 workers positions, or a little over 6% of its headcount, in January after a challenging 2022. Solomon admitted mistakes were made, telling investors: ""I think we’ve accomplished a lot over the past few years. We got some things right, got some things wrong."" ""I read things in the paper that don’t match what’s happening inside the firm,"" Solomon continued, explaining there were fewer partner transitions in 2022 than any other year going back to 2014. ""The culture of Goldman Sachs is incredibly strong. ...We have an extraordinary group of people working incredibly hard,"" he said. ""We also recognize we've gone through a very unusual period over last 3 years — the pandemic was a very tough thing on a culture like ours."" Goldman Sachs shares, down about 5% over the past month, are trading relatively flat year-to-date — underperforming the S&P 500's 3% gain over that same time period. Solomon went on to note Goldman is a ""human business,"" explaining the firm has made conscious decisions to invest in its culture with leadership spending more time with partners throughout the year to help push a greater sense of community throughout the organization. ""We’re going to continue to invest in our culture. I think it's very good, [but] I do think we've had dramatic shifts,"" he said, once again referencing the pandemic which was quickly followed by an unfavorable macro environment. ""That created more noise, more grumbling than usual."" Overall, ""I feel good about the partnerships [and] the culture, but that doesn't mean we don't have to keep investing,"" he reiterated. Goldman saw a rough end to 2022 with profits down a whopping 69% in Q4 amid a serious decline in deal-making revenues, pressured by a weakening economic backdrop. Following Tuesday's presentation, analyst reaction appeared cautiously optimistic, although questions remain over the path to profitability for its consumer banking unit, otherwise known as platform solutions. Shares of Goldman fell about 4% on Tuesday as the company made its pitch to investors. ""Coming out of the conference, the buzz among investors was whether GS will grow the consumer businesses or sell parts of them. Our interpretation of management's commentary is that both options are on the table,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck wrote in a new note published on Wednesday. Graseck maintained her Equal Weight rating and reiterated a 12-month price target of $332 a share. Graseck added all three business segments, which also includes investment banking and trading along with wealth and asset management, ""have an opportunity to contribute to Y/Y EPS growth as GS targets growth opportunities and gets more efficient."" Goldman reported a net loss of $660 million in its platform solutions unit in the fourth quarter with a full-year net loss settling at $1.67 billion. The company blamed the decline on higher provisions for credit losses, but stressed on Tuesday: ""Profitability is not a strategy. It is a priority and the outcome of a strategy well executed."" Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala told clients Wednesday Goldman's profitability push seemed genuine, writing: ""While investors looking for instant gratification may have been disappointed, we believe that management is on the same page with shareholders in that it appreciates the need to further shrink its consumer exposure ""unlock value"" (specifically, card partnerships and point-of-sale lending)."" Poonawala maintained a Buy rating and reiterated a $384 price target on the stock. Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-01,aapl,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/feds-bostic-kashkari-call-for-higher-rates-after-concerning-inflation-jobs-data-150224928.html,"Two Federal Reserve officials speaking Wednesday said more aggressive interest rate hikes are likely necessary to slow inflation, as is the central bank keeping rates at elevated levels for some time. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said Wednesday he is remaining ""open-minded"" about whether the Fed should raise rates by 25 or 50 basis points at its next policy meeting on March 21-22. Markets currently expect a 25 basis point, or 0.25%, rate increase from the central bank. ""I’m open-minded about whether it's 25 or 50 basis points [at the next meeting],"" Kashkari said during a Q&A at a Sioux Falls Business CEO event. ""What's more important is what we signal in the dot plot."" The Fed will release a new set of economic forecasts and interest rate expectations alongside its March 22 policy statement. Kashkari said in December, he jotted down raising interest rates up to 5.4% and holding rates at that level for an extended period. ""At this point I haven't decided what my dot is, but I would lean towards continuing to raise further that I would continue to push up my policy path."" ""Given the data in the last month — higher inflation than we expected and a strong jobs report — these are concerning data points suggesting we're not making progress as quickly as we'd like,"" Kashkari said. ""At the same time shouldn't overreact to one month of data even if the data is troubling."" Kashkari is a voting member of the FOMC, the Fed committee that sets monetary policy, in 2023. Elsewhere, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said Wednesday he believes the Fed needs to raise its policy rate by 50 basis points, to a range of 5%-5.25%, and hold it at that level until well into 2024. ""We must determine when inflation is irrevocably moving lower,"" Bostic wrote in an essay published Wednesday. ""We're not there yet. That's why I think we need to raise the federal funds rate to between 5-5.25% and leave it there well into 2024. This will allow tighter policy to filter through the economy and ultimately bring aggregate supply and aggregate demand into better balance and thus lower inflation."" Bostic is not a voting member of the FOMC in 2023, but will be a voting member in 2024. Bostic said in order to consider reversing the course of monetary policy, he needs to see a better balance in the job market between labor supply and demand and see broad-based inflation narrow. Bostic noted about half of the goods in the CPI market basket still show inflation rates of 6% or higher. The Fed targets inflation that averages 2%. ""If we are going to get inflation back in the range of our target, the breadth of inflation will have to narrow considerably,"" Bostic wrote. ""When inflation is no longer top of mind, our mission will largely be accomplished. We are clearly not there yet. But I—and the Committee—are committed to doing all we can to ensure that we get there as soon as possible."" Both Bostic and Kashkari noted that while the increase in interest rates has slowed the housing and real estate sectors, they aren’t seeing many signs higher rates are really slowing down the rest of the economy. ""Business contacts tell us activity may well soften, but they don't anticipate a severe deterioration,"" Bostic wrote. ""When businesses think customers will buy less of their product or service in the near and medium term, then they will adjust hiring and investment plans accordingly."" Kashkari said the U.S is not in recession right now pointing to strong job growth, but said whether the Fed can avoid causing a recession with its interest rate hikes to fight inflation — a so-called soft-landing —remains an open question. ""The track record is not good at being able to slow down the economy this much without going a little too far and heading into recession,"" he said. ""[But] typically, when the central bank has caused a recession by raising interest rates, the bounce back can be very fast."" Kashkari said the dynamics in this economic cycle are different given families and states have strong balance sheets and supply chains are getting better. Both Fed officials said the cost of raising rates too much outweighs the costs of raising rates too little, adding the Fed must avoid a 1970s scenario in which the central bank cut rates too soon, causing inflation to re-surge and forcing the Volcker-led Fed to hike rates much higher to ultimately bring down inflation.

2023-03-01,aapl,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/consumers-keep-feeling-better-about-today-and-worse-about-tomorrow-morning-brief-103054340.html,"This article first appeared in the Morning Brief.

Follow him on Twitter @MylesUdland and on LinkedIn. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. U.S. consumers and the executives that Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon talks to have a lot in common — they feel good about today and worse about tomorrow. New data out from The Conference Board on Tuesday showed consumer confidence dipped in February, with the decline entirely driven by expectations. The Conference Board's index fell to 102.9 in February from 106 in January and 109 in December; December's reading was the highest since Sept. 2021. Underneath the surface of this decline, however, was another month where a strong labor market lifted consumers' current expectations while fears about the future loomed. ""The present situation index rose for a third straight month, underpinned by upbeat views on employment and business conditions,"" wrote Gurleen Chadha, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, in a note to clients on Tuesday. ""That index rose 1.7pts to 152.8. The differential between jobs 'plentiful' and jobs 'hard to get' rose to 41.5ppts, the highest since April 2022, indicating that current labor market conditions are still quite tight."" In January, the U.S. economy added a surprising 517,000 jobs while the unemployment rate stood at 3.4%. Meanwhile, speaking at Goldman's second-ever investor day on Tuesday, Solomon said the executives he spends his days speaking with are feeling better about a ""soft landing"" for the economy, but that inflation worries are ""hampering confidence."" ""When I talk to CEOs, they feel more uncertain about the course of inflation as we run through 2023, 2024. ...There's a real belief that inflation will be stickier and harder to moderate than markets now predict,"" Solomon said. The Conference Board's data shows consumers remain pleasantly surprised the soft labor market they'd braced for hasn't materialized just as executives fretting over recession remain similarly relieved. And yet both groups in their own way remain braced for some version of economic impact. It's just not clear that hasn't already happened. We're coming off a year in which the S&P 500 fell 19%, the price of gas in the U.S. hit $5 a gallon, and the inflation rate reached 9.1%. In less than a year, the Fed has raised interest rates 4.5%. The housing market got crushed. And the most popular investing strategy for those saving for retirement endured its worst year on record. All things that have improved in 2023. And if there's one theme that been pervasive in markets and the economy for some time now it's a sense from investors and consumers that the worst is yet to come. Economists at Wells Fargo said in a note consumer confidence data ""pours some cold water on the streak of strong economic data received to start the year."" Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, said Tuesday, ""if consumers drive the economy, the outlook for 2023 is bleak as the consumers expect that the worst is yet to come."" On Tuesday, The Conference Board's Expectations Index stood at 69.7, notable as any reading below 80 is typically consistent with recession, according to the report. This index, however, has been below 80 for 11 of the last 12 months. And we wait for the recession still.

2023-02-28,aapl,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-february-28-2023-120603661.html,"U.S. stocks fell Tuesday, rounding out the last day of a volatile month of February on Wall Street. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) edged lower by 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined 0.7%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ticked down by 0.1%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked up to 3.92% Tuesday afternoon. The U.S. benchmark WTI crude oil moved higher to trade around $76.94 a barrel. The dollar index was up, trading at $104.92. Stocks closed higher on Monday, fueling a temporary rebound from Wall Street's worst week of the year. All three indexes ended February in the red after an optimistic start to the year in January. Economic data released on Tuesday showed that retail inventories, excluding auto, rose 0.3%, higher than 0.1% expected by economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Meanwhile, wholesale inventories declined 0.4%, below consensus estimates of 0.1%. American consumers felt worse about the economy in February, the Confidence Board reported. The board's Consumer Confidence Index slumped to 102.9 from 106.0, below consensus estimates of 108.5,  Meanwhile, February Chicago PMI dipped to 43.6 from 44.3, also below consensus expectations. “Consumers and businesses are looking for ways to reduce expenses in anticipation of much weaker activity over the rest of the year. The drop in consumer confidence in February aligns with weaker business confidence readings as the Fed’s sharp increase in interest rates start to bite,"" Ben Ayers, Nationwide senior economist, wrote in a statement. Other data showed that home prices fell 0.5% in December, according to data from S&P Corelogic Case-Shiller Index. On a yearly basis, home prices rose 4.6%, lower than analysts' expectations of 4.8%. As inflation still remains sticky, Federal Reserve Governor Philip Jefferson on Monday shot down arguments for raising the central bank’s 2% inflation target and said he is under ""no illusion"" that it's going to be easy to get the inflation rate back down. This week, investors will remain focused on the retail sector. On Tuesday, earnings from Target (TGT) topped analysts' expectations as consumer spending continues to move away from discretionary categories. The retailer’s same-store sales grew by 0.7%, above estimates of a 1.74% decline. The stock rose about 1% on Tuesday. Data from Bespoke Investment Group showed that over the last week, 420 stocks have reported earnings and the percentage of companies lowering guidance is more than double the percentage raising guidance, signaling ""lots of trouble for these smaller-cap companies that report late in the season."" In other single stock moves, Zoom (ZM) shares rose after the company posted better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings, with earnings per share of $1.22 higher than estimates of 80 cents. Revenue came in at $1.12 billion. Occidental Petroleum (OXY) shares moved down on Tuesday after the oil and gas producer posted fourth-quarter results that came in below Wall Street expectations on revenue and earnings per share. Shares of Workday (WDAY) were up after the human-resources software company topped expectations with revenue of $1.65 billion, up 20% year-over-year, against estimates of $1.63 billion. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (AMC) fell jumped on Tuesday after a Delaware court said it would hold a hearing on April 27, which will likely delay the date of conversion of convertible units APE to common stock. Tesla (TSLA) shares fell around 1% as Mexico's president confirmed that the EV maker will build a new plant in Monterrey, Mexico. The Mexican president said more details will be released at Tesla's investor day, and he said the plant is expected to be ""very big."" Shares of Coinbase (COIN) surged as fears of crypto regulation begin to fade. On Monday, the company was served a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission as the regulatory agency cracks down on cryptocurrency listings, its custody of digital assets and platform operations, and more, the company disclosed. Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) shares sank after the company reported a wider-than-expected loss and forecasted disappointing guidance for 2023 as the cruise operator gets squeezed by soaring fuel and labor costs. Separately, Bank of Nova Scotia shares dropped after the Canadian lender reported a missed in earnings estimates as a lull in its investment banking division dented income from its capital markets unit. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. Today the process opens for semiconductor companies to apply for a piece of the $39 billion grant money being allocated as part of the CHIPS and Science Act. But there's a catch: firms that win the funds may not be able to buy back stock – for a while, anyway. “We want to make sure that their money is being used to increase research and development in innovation and not to pad their bottom line or do buybacks,” said Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in an interview with Yahoo Finance. One could argue it’s the administration’s prerogative to decide how chipmakers that accept grants to build factories use that money. But the White House wants to go further, by boosting taxes on buybacks from their current 1%. In his State of the Union address earlier this month, President Joe Biden said that tax should be much higher: ""Corporations ought to do the right thing. That’s why I propose we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks and encourage long-term investments. They’ll still make considerable profit."" That proposal is what may have led Warren Buffett to weigh in on the hot-button issue in the Berkshire Hathaway CEO’s annual letter to investors: “When you are told that all repurchases are harmful to shareholders or to the country, or particularly beneficial to CEOs, you are listening to either an economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue (characters that are not mutually exclusive).” Even Buffett has a caveat, however: he says buybacks make sense only if they are made at “value-accretive prices,” i.e. when corporations don’t overpay. Taking a step back, corporations have a number of ways to spend their money, from building new plants to hiring people to research and development. They can also distribute the funds directly to shareholders by paying out dividends. Or they can repurchase shares, which has the effect of reducing overall share count, automatically increasing earnings per share. (In a simplified example, if a company makes $1 million in profit and has 50,000 shares outstanding, earnings per share are $20. If it buys back 10,000 of its shares, earnings per share go to $25, making an existing shareholder's stake more valuable.) And the numbers are a lot bigger than in the example above. Last year, U.S. companies announced a record $1.223 trillion of buybacks, according to data from EPFR TrimTabs. This year, it’s already running at $274.9 billion — heating up even after the 1% tax kicked in. Eliminating or restricting that tool, then, would be a big deal. Will it actually happen? In the case of companies accepting money as part of the CHIPS Act, it’s unclear whether they’ll be barred from doing buybacks at all, or just directly using the funding they’ve received. (Senator Elizabeth Warren and some of her colleagues in Congress want the participants to be barred from doing buybacks for 10 years). Secretary Raimondo said each case will be different, but the government will in theory have the ability to claw back money in the “most extreme cases” if companies do not comply with their agreements, whether that deals with buybacks or other stipulations. Investors in companies like Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) should take note, since they’re among the firms that have announced plans to build plants in the U.S. and are likely to apply for federal funding. As for whether a broader clampdown on buybacks is coming, policy analyst Ed Mills is skeptical. “Really, what this is about is setting up a strawman, as we get into debates about the debt ceiling,” Mills, a managing director at Raymond James, told Yahoo Finance in an interview. On the one hand, Republicans will fire up their rhetoric about getting the U.S. fiscal house in order. Democrats, led by President Biden, are likely to shoot back by saying Republicans aren’t willing to ask companies enacting big buybacks to pay more in taxes. “I don't think it happens, but I think it's going to be more part of the conversation than I think the market anticipates right now,” Mills said.

The Minneapolis-based retailer saw same-store sales increase by 0.7%, higher than Wall Street estimates of -1.74%. Similar to Walmart's (WMT) latest quarterly results, consumer spending at Target seemed to shift to essentials like food and away from categories like electronics, home, and apparel. Target shares jumped by more than 3.5% in pre-market trading after the report's release. Target CEO Brian Cornell said the team was pleased with the sales growth in what continues to be a ""very challenging environment."" Here's what Target reported, compared to Wall Street estimates, based on Bloomberg consensus data: Revenue: $31.40 billion versus $30.46 billion expected Adjusted earnings per share: $1.89 versus $1.48 expected Same-store sales: 0.7% versus -1.74% expected Brick & mortar same-store sales: up 1.9% versus -2.80% expected Cornell said having multiple category offerings, including food & beverage, in addition to beauty and household items served the retailer well this past quarter, Cornell said. ""Strength in Food & Beverage, Beauty and Household Essentials offset ongoing softness in discretionary categories. This performance highlights the benefit of our multi-category merchandise assortment, which drives relevance with our guests in any environment, and is a key reason we grew traffic every quarter last year."" Same-store sales beat estimates, up 0.7% compared to expectations of a decline of 1.74%. Same-store sales at physical locations also got a boost, up 1.9%, while digital sales dropped 3.6% in Q4. At the end of Q4, inventory was 3% lower than 2021. Meanwhile, in discretionary categories like electronics, home and apparel, inventory was nearly 13% lower than 2021, ""partially offset by higher inventory in frequency categories."" For full-year fiscal 2022 results, revenue grew by $3 billion, to $109 billion. Compared to 2019, revenue is up more than $30 billion. In the full-year, same-store sales increased 2.2%, while traffic was up 2.1%. Looking ahead to fiscal 2023, Cornell said the retailer is focused on it's long-term strategy and ""continued differentiation through affordability, assortment, ease and convenience"" as it competes with other retailers for consumers trading down. ""At the same time, we’re planning our business cautiously in the near term to ensure we remain agile and responsive to the current operating environment...as we plan for the year ahead, we will continue to make robust capital investments and pursue efficiency opportunities in support of our long-term growth."" For the first-quarter of 2023, the company expects a wide range for same-store sales, from a low-single digit decline to a low-single increase, and an operating income margin rate of 4-5%. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.50 to $1.90. For fiscal-year 2023, the company expects same-store sales to be the same, from low-single digit to a low-single increase, along with an operating income of more than $1 billion and adjusted EPS to range from $7.75 to $8.75. In the next 3 years, the company aims to move beyond its pre-pandemic operating income margin rate of 6%, and says it could possibly reach that goal as early as fiscal 2024, ""depending on the speed of recovery for the economy and consumer demand."" — Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose by 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.2%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased by 0.6%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked down to 3.93% Monday. On the economic data side, new orders for manufactured durable goods in January plunged to 4.5%, the biggest drop since April 2020, the Census Bureau reported. The drop was more pronounced than economist estimates of 4.0%. ""The manufacturing sector will remain under pressure in the months ahead, but the details of January's report of durable goods orders and shipments suggest factory activity started the year on a better note than the headline figure would suggest,"" Lydia Boussour, EY Parthenon senior economist, wrote in a statement following the release. Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors’ index of pending home sales climbed 8.1% to 82.5 in January, sharply higher from the projected rise of 1.0% by Bloomberg economists, according to data the group released on Monday. On a yearly basis, however, pending transactions plunged by nearly 24%. ""The increase in the Pending Home Sales Index confirms that the US housing market has improved, or better put, has somewhat stabilized over the last several months due to lower mortgage interest rates,"" Raymond James chief economist Eugenio Aleman wrote in statement to Yahoo Finance. ""However, the recent increase in mortgage rates is probably going to inflict some more pain on the US housing market going forward."" Stocks closed out their worst week of 2023 on Friday after the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge showed it unexpectedly accelerated in January and consumer spending jumped. The “core” Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index – which excludes volatile food and energy components – showed prices climbed 0.6% in January and 4.7% from last year. The Commerce Department also reported consumer spending rose 1.8% last month from December, the largest increase in nearly two years. The survey’s results renewed anxiety among investors that the Fed would continue its aggressive tightening campaign against inflation. The drop in optimism pressured the major indexes, as the Dow Jones dropped 3% for its fourth consecutive losing week, while the S&P 500 shed 2.7% in its worst week since early December and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.3%. Data compiled by 22V Research has found that rising interest rates have increased the correlation between growth and value stocks to the highest level since at least 2005. This week, investors will remain keen on the retail sector, with earnings from Target (TGT) on deck before market open on Tuesday after Walmart (WMT) warned of cautious profit guidance for the year ahead. Home improvement retail giant Home Depot (HD) also had disappointing guidance for fiscal 2023. Elsewhere on the earnings calendar are results from Costco (COST), Macy's (M), Dollar Tree (DLTR), and Kohl's (KSS) to feature the retail side. Meanwhile, the share of companies topping analysts' expectations in the fourth quarter has been low compared to history. Data from FactSet showed that 68% of S&P 500 companies reported fourth quarter earnings that beat expectations, down from the five-year average of 77% and the 10-year average of 73%. In single stock moves, Seagen Inc. (SGEN) shares jumped Monday morning after a report from The Wall Street Journal said Pfizer (PFE) is in early-stage talks to acquire the cancer drugmaker company in what could be a multi-billion dollar deal. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK-B) stock rose following CEO Warren Buffett’s annual letter to shareholders, which offered readers a glimpse into his views on share buybacks, taxes, corporate accounting, and his sense of optimism about the economy. Shares of fuboTV (FUBO) sank after the sports-focused streaming service issued disappointing guidance in its fourth-quarter earnings report on Monday and disclosed that it had sold stock at a deeply discounted price. Fisker (FSR) shares jumped Monday after the electric vehicle startup announced its deliveries for its first vehicle, the Ocean SUV, would be completed by spring. Shares of Union Pacific (UNP) climbed after the largest freight operator announced its plans to name a new chief executive following pressure from activists to oust Lance Fritz from the job. Bath & Body Works (BBWI) shares fell after the company said in a letter to shareholders that the looming proxy battle is based on ""misguided"" motivations and would be detrimental to shareholders. The board made the decision to not appoint former Third Point co-chief investment officer Munib Islam. Elsewhere, in cryptocurrency news, Coinbase (COIN) said in a tweet that it will soon suspend trading for Binance's stablecoin, Binance USD, on March 13 at or around noon ET. The move comes after Paxos Trust disclosed it will stop creating the Binance-branded stablecoin, citing regulatory pressure. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. Salesforce is facing a defining moment in its 24-year history. Growth is slowing. Analysts are worried fundamentals will get worse before they get better as companies curtail tech spending amid a sluggish global economy. A fresh round of layoffs at Salesforce have just been uncorked....at a company that has only known aggressive hiring. Employees are questioning leadership at the tech titan. Co-CEO Bret Taylor is no longer co-CEO of Salesforce — instead he's off to launch an AI startup the serial entrepreneur tells me. Slack founder Stewart Butterfield, who stayed on when the company was acquired by Salesforce, is still founder...but no longer with the parent company. Salesforce co-founder Marc Benioff is back at the CEO helm, after attempting again to pullback from day to day duties (by delegating to a co-CEO) and focus more on his vast philanthropic ventures. To top it all off the company is staring down the barrel of five sharks in the field of activist money management: Elliott Management, Starboard Value, Inclusive Capital, ValueAct, and Third Point. This is an unprecedented activist versus public company battle, pros have told Yahoo Finance. How it ends is wildly unclear, but is a situation just as important as Wednesday's earnings report. ""While the involvement of five activist investors has likely been the primary driver of CRM stock of late, quarterly results probably still matter (though not as much as usual), and how those results are delivered may be more relevant than ever,"" said Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci. Below, Yahoo Finance breaks down this complicated situation at large-cap tech name Salesforce. The drama is high, and it could all be coming down to one final epic conclusion. What Yahoo Finance Is Watching: Salesforce Earnings What sources tell us is top of mind on the Street: How quickly are sales deteriorating inside of the broader tech pullback? What does the pipeline of future business look like? Does Marc Benioff acknowledge the activist situation? Are more layoffs needed? Consensus is that Salesforce warns on sales and earnings for 2023 – but how bad is it? The Vibe Among Wall Street Analysts Analysts are generally expecting a muted tone from Salesforce on earnings day. “For Benioff and Salesforce the actual quarter and FY24 take a back seat to the fluid activist situation which is happening at Salesforce with the Street's patience wearing thin after a head scratcher Slack deal and slowing growth/underachieving margins front and center.” -Wedbush analyst Dan Ives ""Key to the Q4 call is gaining clarity on the extent to which management will turn the dial up on non-GAAP operating margins, GAAP profitability, and any future share repurchases with the emergence of activist involvement in the stock."" -Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss What the Activists Want From Salesforce Sources tell Yahoo Finance that Starboard Value — led by veteran activist investor and Papa John's chairman Jeff Smith — has been disappointed in Salesforce’s expense management, but isn’t advocating for a sale of Slack. Other activists involved in the situation are keen to see a Slack sale even at a low price as a show of faith by management they will improve margins, sources say. Overall, we are told the activists are entrenched and want clear changes from Salesforce leadership. Key thing the activist pool wants: Higher profit margins Realistic 2023 guidance Clear succession plan from CEO co-founder Marc Benioff Like we said, this earnings report is a defining moment in the history of Salesforce.

2023-02-26,aapl,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stocks-under-pressure-retail-earnings-continue-what-to-know-this-week-142308388.html,"The 2023 stock market rally is under pressure. Inflation data last week that topped expectations — as well as a continued drop in optimism the Federal Reserve's rate hikes will end sooner rather than later — pressured the major indexes with the Dow logging a fourth-straight losing week and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq suffering their worst weeks of the year, losing 2.7% and 3.4%, respectively. The Dow endured its worst weekly performance since Sept. 2022. In the week ahead, investors will remain keyed in on the retail sector, with results from Target (TGT) in focus after rival Walmart (WMT) issued a warning on the state of U.S. consumers last week. On the economic data side, a crowded calendar of reports from the housing and manufacturing sectors — two areas of the economy which have most reflected the impact of policy tightening — is on tap along with a key measure of consumer confidence. On Friday, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index — the Fed's preferred assessment of how quickly prices are rising across the economy — showed prices rose 0.6% during the month of January and 5.4% over last year. On a ""core"" basis, which strips out volatile food and energy components, prices rose 0.6% for the month and at an annual clip of 4.7%. The week marked a turning point in sentiment around inflation expectations and the path forward for interest rates. The hotter-than-expected PCE index followed upside surprises to inflation this year from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and producer prices, which showed the largest increases in several months to start the year. ""The bear market rally that began in October from reasonable prices and low expectations has morphed into a speculative frenzy based on a Fed pause/pivot that isn't coming,"" Morgan Stanley's top strategist Mike Wilson said in a note to clients last week. Wilson's forecast sees the S&P 500 bottoming out at 3,000 this year. On Friday, the benchmark U.S. equity index closed at 3,970. ""Investor optimism had already been hit by a slow puncture this week but it's deflating more rapidly as the latest data indicates that the work in taming inflation is far from over,"" Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in a note. Standout economic data releases in the week ahead include the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index, ISM's manufacturing PMI, and The Conference Board's consumer confidence reading for February. On the corporate side, Target will release its fourth-quarter earnings results before market open on Tuesday with results from Costco (COST), Macy's (M), Dollar Tree (DLTR), and Kohl's (KSS) also featuring on the retail side. Last week, Walmart's CFO John David Rainey said the ""consumer is still very pressured, and if you look at economic indicators, balance sheets are running thinner and savings rates are declining relative to previous periods."" ""We expect Target's results will look similar to Walmart's, with better-than-expected sales, more gross margin pressure than predicted, and solid opex leverage in the store,"" Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe said in a note.

2023-02-24,aapl,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-today-february-24-2023-104349492.html,"U.S. stocks tumbled Friday after the Federal Reserve's most closely watched inflation measure came in stronger than expected, in another sign that price pressures have become sticky into 2023. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) sank 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) plopped more than 300 points, or 1%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid 1.7%. Friday marked the worst week for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq since December. U.S. Treasury yields scrambled higher following the reading. The 2-year note surged 12 basis points to 4.81% while the 10-year note gained 7 basis points to top 3.95%. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index — the Fed's preferred assessment of how quickly prices are rising across the economy — rose 0.6% in January and 5.4% from last year. On a ""core"" basis, which strips out volatile food and energy components, prices rose 0.6% for the month and 4.7% from last year. The report from the Commerce Department also showed that consumer spending rose 1.8% last month from December after falling the previous month. The numbers support recent indications inflation is not falling at the pace and extent investors have been hoping for, even as prices have stabilized from the peaks of the current inflation cycle. “First December CPI was revised higher, and now each reading for January surprised to the upside. Inflation’s like an old boyfriend or girlfriend that keeps showing up when you don’t want to see them,"" David Russell, Vice President of Market Intelligence at TradeStation said in a note. In individual stock moves, Block (SQ) rose 4.3% after the payments processor reported fourth-quarter financial results that saw profit and revenue top expectations. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) shares fell 1% after the media giant posted a big revenue loss for the final three months of the year. Boeing (BA) shares closed down 4.8% after the airline manufacturer said it paused deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner jets because of a documentation issue. Beyond Meat's (BYND) stock rallied 10% after better-than-expected earnings and CEO Ethan Brown said the company is seeing progress in its efforts to cut costs and manufacturing hurdles. Beleaguered used car retailer (CVNA) plunged 20.5% after reporting a net loss that was nine times wider in the fourth quarter. The bumpier-than-anticipated road to restoring price stability and strong economic data to start the year — nonfarm payrolls rose by 517,000 in January while retail sales surged 3% — have prompted investors to readjust expectations around the path forward for interest rates, putting a dent in the market's recent momentum. The S&P 500 snapped a four-day losing streak on Thursday as stocks closed higher. But earlier this week on Tuesday, stocks had their worst day of the year. ""Equity bulls and even Chair Powell have bragged about anchored expectations for inflation and how consumers and investors believe it is moving in the right direction,"" Morgan Stanley Chief Investment Officer Lisa Shalett said in a note earlier this week, noting that January's Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) raised questions about whether inflation progress is stalling. ""Given data crosscurrents, the central bank needs to tread carefully. Investors still wagering on a 'Fed put; or quick return to financial repression are apt to be wrong this time,"" Shalett said. ""Fed credibility is on the line, and it is likely to risk overshooting rather than quitting the inflation fight too early."" — Alexandra Semenova is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-02-24,aapl,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/fed-inflation-fight-longer-pce-index-173353572.html,"Two Federal Reserve officials suggested Friday morning that inflation could persist longer than thought after the central bank's most closely watched inflation gauge surged by the most in months. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Fed Governor Philip Jefferson said they remain concerned about an inflation rate that remains well above the Fed's 2% year-over-year target. Mester reiterated that while inflation has moderated, the overall level remains too high. She noted recent research from the Cleveland Fed and a discussion paper that have suggested inflation could be more persistent than currently anticipated. “I see the risks to the inflation forecast as tilted to the upside and the costs of continued high inflation as being significant,” Mester said at the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum in New York. “So in my view, at this point, with the labor market still strong, the costs of undershooting on policy or prematurely loosening policy still outweigh the costs of overshooting.” The comments came as the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation – the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index – unexpectedly accelerated in January, rising 5.4% last month on an annual basis. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the inflation gage rose 4.7%, both marking pickups after several months of declines. On a monthly basis, the PCE index rose 0.6% in January compared with December. Core prices also rose 0.6% in January from the prior month, compared with December’s 0.4% increase. The numbers Friday came a week after the government released the Consumer Price Index, which showed a similar pickup in the inflation rate. The hot read on inflation hit markets on renewed rate hike fears, with the Dow Jones Industrial average tanking 336 points. ""By betting on a terminal rate above 5.35%, the market is effectively betting that the recent momentum in both growth and inflation will be sustained through the summer,"" Jefferies chief economist Aneta Markowska said. Mester, who does not vote on monetary policy decisions this year, told Bloomberg in an interview Friday morning that the latest inflation reading shows the Fed needs to keep raising interest rates but stopped short of suggesting it required a 50-basis-point rate hike at the next policy meeting in March. Mester said last week she wanted to raise the benchmark policy rate by 50 basis points at the last policy meeting to try to get to the peak rate faster, though she also didn't want to surprise markets. In a separate interview Friday morning with CNBC, Mester signaled her forecast in December to raise rates a bit above 5% hasn’t changed much. Speaking at the same Monetary Policy Forum on Friday, Boston Fed President Susan Collins said inflation is still too high and that the Fed has more work to do. “Inflation remains too high, and recent data …all reinforce my view that we have more work to do, to bring inflation down to the 2 percent target,” said Collins. “I anticipate further rate increases to reach a sufficiently restrictive level, then holding there for some, perhaps extended, time.” Also speaking at the conference, Jefferson said a limited supply of workers for jobs needed, which has pushed up wages, suggests inflation may cool slowly. “The ongoing imbalance between the supply and demand for labor, combined with the large share of labor costs in the services sector, suggests that high inflation may come down only slowly,” he said. Jefferson also said the forces driving inflation now are different that past inflationary episodes and therefore economic models won’t be as helpful to policymakers. Jefferson said the current situation is different because the pandemic created unprecedented disruptions to global supply chains and is having a long-lasting impact on the labor participation rate. “The inflationary forces impinging on the U.S. economy at present represent a complex mixture of temporary and more long-lasting elements that defy simple, parsimonious explanation,” he said. Jefferson says he thinks the Fed is addressing the spike in inflation proactively, unlike in the 1970s and has more credibility now.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. What's old may be new again for U.S. stock investors. The end of zero-interest rate policies (ZIRP) is likely to mark a shift in equity market favorites from long-leading technology names to sectors like energy, materials and housing — or what strategists at Bank of America deem part of ""the old economy."" ""Bear markets have historically resulted in leadership change, which suggests old economy sectors are likely the winners of this cycle,"" Savita Subramanian, BofA’s head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy said in a note earlier this week. With these components of the market depleted of capital over the past ten years as Big Tech was powered by free money, the ""pendulum is expected to swing back"" in their direction, Subramanian noted. Despite the big gains across January in these very stocks that were battered throughout 2022, investors have called the moves higher this year a bear market rally rather than the start of a new bull market. ""I think the stock market is in a protracted bear market,"" DoubleLine Capital founder and CEO Jeffrey Gundlach told Yahoo Finance Live in an interview Wednesday (video above), adding it began in the fourth quarter of 2021. ""[It's] very negative for the stock market when you have rising interest rates against these valuations, especially real interest rates,"" Gundlach said, adding a pause in the increase in real rates this fall was a catalyst for the recovery in risk assets. ""But it looks like real interest rates might start rising again."" Meanwhile on Sunday, Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson told clients in a not that the recent rally was ""a speculative frenzy"" based on false hopes for a pivot by the Federal Reserve. Equity markets are in the throes of a recent shift in the narrative for where interest rates will go, finally taking Fed officials at face value as they vow to lift their policy rate above 5% this year. Bank of America indicated its analysis of equity risk premium shows growth stocks were not pricing in recession risk and the expected higher-for-longer rate environment is projected to pressure long-duration growth stocks. Whatever the rest of the year holds for the U.S. stock market, signs have already emerged of an imminent change in leadership. Last year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average crushed the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite, for example, falling less than 10% in 2022 while the latter index wiped out more than one third of its value. As Yahoo Finance’s Jared Blikre pointed out, the Dow’s outperformance relative to the tech index was by far the biggest gap since the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. Goldman Sachs’s chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin warned in November that the ""exceptionalism of technology is arguably behind us. In 2022, the aggregate market capitalization of the current ""tetrad of largest stocks,"" as Goldman Sachs put it — Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) – fell to 18% from 22% the prior year. And those top four stocks lost an aggregate -25% compared to -13% for the remaining stocks in the index during the period. ""With the end of ZIRP, we see the pendulum swinging back to the old economy as prolonged underinvestment has led to supply issues in the old economy,"" Subramanian said. Bank of America itself raised metals to overweight, and is overweight energy, a testament to its confidence in the leadership transition.

2023-03-10,aapl,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/apple-gets-mojo-back-shaky-143855096.html,"(Bloomberg) -- After a shaky start to the year, Apple Inc.’s stock has once again reclaimed the mantle of the go-to investment in Big Tech, even winning support from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. after years in which the brokerage refrained from recommending the shares. Most Read from Bloomberg One Bank Folds, Another Wobbles and Wall Street Asks If It’s a Crisis SVB Races to Prevent Bank Run as Funds Advise Pulling Cash Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund Advises Companies to Withdraw Money From SVB Companies Are Telling Us the Real Reason They're Still Raising Prices Why Is Everyone Talking About SVB? Here's Everything We Know About the Bank Right Now The Cupertino, California-based giant has risen about 15% in 2023 and is on course for the biggest quarterly gain in more than a year. The stock is outperforming fellow mega-cap technology companies like Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. Concerns about an imminent drop in demand for Apple’s pricey computers and iPhones, along with supply bottlenecks, have dissipated. Goldman this week turned bullish on the stock for the first time in almost six years, after being mostly on the sidelines as the stock more than quadrupled in value. “Apple’s strong balance sheet, talented team, and innovation capabilities could be viewed by investors as a safe place to park equity exposure,” said David Waddell, chief investment strategist at Waddell and Associates. Rewind to December and the picture looked gloomy: A fresh wave of Covid infections in China led to its key assembly partner shutting down production of iPhones in the run up to Apple’s biggest quarter. The stock slumped to a 19-month low in early January and the company’s market value dipped below $2 trillion for the first time since March 2021. The Federal Reserve’s series of interest rate increases also was crimping shares of all highly valued technology companies while sparking concern that the economy would tip into recession, hurting sales of computers and phones. Now the factory is back online, supply chain snarls have dissipated and demand seems to be holding up. Apple also is seeing limited impact from economic pressures, Kyle McNealy, an analyst at Jefferies, wrote in a note last week, citing data on traffic to web pages by consumers looking to buy iPhones. That indicates that expectations for handset sales may be too low, he said. Goldman analyst Michael Ng, who just took over the firm’s coverage of the stock with a buy rating, says the company’s large user base also will allow it to expand its services unit. The business, which houses services like Apple Music, Apple TV+ and the App Store, makes up about a fifth of the company’s total revenue — doubling its share over the past decade. Analysts see strong growth drivers in other business units too. Bloomberg Intelligence predicts the company will rake in $22 billion in sales of AirPod earphones in 2024, an amount equal to Mastercard’s total revenue last year. And with the Federal Reserve warning that the pace of rate hikes may need to re-accelerate, investors are looking to a stock that has served them well during uncertain times. Apple has been rewarding shareholders: The company has bought back $88 billion in stock over the last 12 months. That’s the most by any US and almost more than the combined repurchases of its two closest competitors, Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock is by no means cheap, but trading at 24 times forward earnings it’s much more reasonable compared to the 35 times it traded at during the pandemic. Analysts expect the stock to rise about 13% over the next 12 months, based on the average price target compiled by Bloomberg. Tech Chart of the Day Apple’s share repurchases overtook those of Exxon Mobil Corp. in 2013, making it the company with the biggest annual buybacks in the S&P 500 Index. The iPhone maker has remained the top spender on its own shares, typically boosting its repurchase program along with its fiscal second-quarter earnings update, meaning the next increase may come in April. Top Tech Stories Panic spread across the startup world as worries about the financial health of Silicon Valley Bank, a major lender to fledgling companies, prompted Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund and other prominent venture capitalists to advise portfolio businesses to withdraw their money, even as the bank’s top executive urged calm. Oracle Corp. reported quarterly sales in line with analysts’ estimates after its cloud business failed to meet expectations for higher growth. The shares declined in extended trading. The US is working to close a loophole in restrictions imposed on Inspur Group that leaves American companies such as Intel Corp. free to keep supplying the Chinese server maker’s affiliates. Sea Ltd. and GoTo Group, two of Southeast Asia’s largest internet companies, are embarking on fresh layoffs as the region’s once high-flying tech leaders retrench to focus on profitability over growth. ASMPT Ltd., a semiconductor and electronics equipment maker, is attracting takeover interest from private equity firms, people with knowledge of the matter said. --With assistance from Ryan Vlastelica and Tom Contiliano.

2023-03-10,aapl,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/warren-buffett-blasted-public-figures-150000560.html,"Companies have been spending billions of dollars on buybacks and not everyone is a fan. But if you are against all buybacks, legendary investor Warren Buffett wants to give you a wake-up call. Here's how much money the average middle-class American household makes — how do you stack up? UBS says 61% of millionaire collectors allocate up to 30% of their overall portfolio to this exclusive asset class Here's how much the average American 60-year-old holds in retirement savings — how does your nest egg compare? “When you are told that all repurchases are harmful to shareholders or to the country, or particularly beneficial to CEOs, you are listening to either an economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue (characters that are not mutually exclusive),” Buffett says in his company Berkshire Hathaway’s latest annual letter to shareholders. He explains what actually happens to investors when Berkshire buys back its own shares. “The math isn’t complicated: When the share count goes down, your interest in our many businesses goes up. Every small bit helps if repurchases are made at value-accretive prices.” Opponents of stock buybacks include current U.S. President Joe Biden. During his State of the Union address last month, Biden called big oil companies’ profits ‘outrageous’ and slammed their buybacks. “They invested too little of that profit to increase domestic production and keep gas prices down. Instead, they used those record profits to buy back their own stock, rewarding their CEOs and shareholders,” Biden said, proposing to quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks. Whether you like share repurchases or not, they serve as a means for companies to return cash to investors. Here’s a look at three major holdings in Buffett’s portfolio that are particularly generous with buybacks. Apple (AAPL) is Buffett’s largest publicly traded holding, representing around 40% of Berkshire’s portfolio by market value. In the latest earnings conference call, management revealed that the company’s active installed base has surpassed two billion devices. While competitors offer cheaper devices, millions of users don’t want to live outside of the Apple ecosystem. The ecosystem acts as an economic moat, allowing the company to earn oversized profits. The company is returning some of that profits to shareholders through buybacks. In the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2022, Apple spent $19.48 billion on share repurchases. Given the amount of cash that the tech gorilla has, more buybacks could be on the way. At the end of December, Apple’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled $165.45 billion.

Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds American Express (AXP) is the fourth-largest holding at Berkshire Hathaway. Owning 151.6 million shares of AXP, Berkshire’s stake is worth around $26.8 billion. The company stands to benefit in an inflationary environment. American Express makes most of its money through discount fees — merchants are charged a percentage of every Amex card transaction. As the price of goods and services increases, the company gets to take a cut of larger bills. In Q4 of 2022, the company repurchased 4 million of its common shares, reducing the number of shares outstanding from 747 million to 743 million. Buffett highlighted what American Express and Apple have been doing in the shareholder letter. “At Apple and Amex, repurchases increased Berkshire’s ownership a bit without any cost to us.” Chevron (CVX) is one of the big oil companies that gushed huge profits last year. The company reported earnings of $35.5 billion for 2022, which represented a 127% increase from 2021. Sales and other operating revenues totaled $235.7 billion for 2022, up 51% year over year. In January, Chevron’s board approved a 6% increase to the quarterly dividend rate to $1.51 per share. The board also approved a new $75 billion stock buyback program. In 2022, Chevron repurchased nearly 70 million shares for $11.25 billion. President Biden may not like these numbers, but Buffett probably won’t mind. According to an SEC filing, Berkshire owned $29.3 billion of the energy giant at the end of December, making it the third-largest public holding of the company.

CNBC's David Faber reported early Friday SVB's planned capital raise announced earlier this week had not cleared the market, and that the firm was now seeking to sell itself. Turmoil for SVB began when the California based bank filed a surprise announcement of a $1.8 billion loss following a deposit outflow and plans to raise $2.25 billion by selling common and preferred stock. Silicon Valley Bank primarily serves startups and technology firms, which have been under pressure as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.  Silicon Valley’s CEO Greg Becker urged calm with venture capitalists Thursday in a call, according to The Information, and asked them not to withdraw money. Bloomberg reported that venture capitalists have urged portfolio companies to trim their exposure to the lender. Another California bank that serves cryptocurrency clients, Silvergate Capital, announced a “voluntary liquidation” Wednesday, the same day Silicon Valley Bank announced its ill-fated capital raise. Shares were also halted in Signature Bank (SBNY), a New York institution that serves some cryptocurrency clients, after its shares dropped more than 16%. First Republic Bank (FRC), which serves some companies in the venture world and also targets high-net worth clients from the tech industry, saw shares fall as much as 40% early Friday. Concerns about risks to other banks spread on Thursday as stocks of giant financial institutions tumbled. A major bank index fell by the most Thursday in nearly three years. Shares for JP Morgan Chase (JPM) fell 5.41% Thursday and shares were roughly flat during Friday's open. Shares of Bank of America (BAC) fell 6.20% Thursday and opened Friday down more than 2%. Citigroup (C) shares fell 4.20% Thursday and opened Friday down more than 1%. Shares of Goldman Sachs Group (GS) fell 7.20% Thursday and an additional 2% Friday. In a Friday morning note, Morgan Stanley analysts said they don’t anticipate this SVB Financial’s challenges will cripple other regional banks. “The funding pressures facing SIVB are highly idiosyncratic and should not be viewed as a read-across to other regional banks,” according to the note. “We do not believe there is a liquidity crunch facing the banking industry, and most banks in our coverage have ample access to liquidity.” David Hollerith is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-10,tsla,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-today-live-updates-march-10-2023-123845899.html,"U.S. stock futures were mixed Friday morning ahead of a crucial jobs report that will provide another snapshot of the strength of the economy and provide further clues to the path of the Fed's rate-hiking campaign. Futures tied to the S&P 500 (^GSPC) were down 0.2% ahead of the open, while futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined 0.3%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) edged up by 0.1%. January’s job report blew past expectations, as the U.S. economy added more than half a million jobs and the unemployment rate dipped to 3.4%, a level not seen since 1969. But economists aren’t expecting another surprise for Friday’s February jobs print. Consensus estimates from economists are for job gains of 225,000, a slower pace from the January’s blowout number. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.4%. “Signs of slowing outnumber signs of strength, making the chance that last month was a fluke likely,” Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, wrote in a note Friday morning. “At the same time, labor demand continues strong, which suggests a significant drop is also unlikely. A return to the previous trend makes the most sense.” The Federal Reserve has been keeping a close eye on all fronts to the labor market as the central bank tries to cool down inflation. The Friday’s jobs print will show whether January’s hiring gain was an outlier or the start of economic acceleration. Another key point of focus will be wage growth — and whether or not the trend accelerated last month. Meanwhile, other recent data continues to show the economy remains resilient. Consumer spending surged in January, inflation stayed sticky, and business activity expanded in February. The accumulation of economic data, coupled with comments this week from Chair Jerome Powell, has sparked the debate on whether a 0.25% or 0.50% rate hike from the Fed is likely for its March meeting. However, recent events in the banking world have spurred other concerns for Fed officials as their monetary tightening policy induces stresses into the banking system. A major tech firm lender revealed it’s in deep trouble. Silicon Valley Bank’s (SIVB) share price tanked 60% on Thursday, wiping out $9.6 billion of market value after announcing it needs to raise $2.25 billion to offset a $1.8 billion loss on some bond sales. The sour sentiment has spread across markets as the KBW Bank index (^BKX) was down over 7%, while index members including Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) edged lower Friday morning in premarket trading. Elsewhere, in the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin (BTC) crumbled below $20,000 Friday amid liquidation of Silvergate Capital (SI) and regulatory pressures on the industry. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-10,tsla,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/february-jobs-report-march-10-2023-124602371.html,"The February jobs report is expected to show a slowdown in job growth from the start of 2023 while reinforcing the U.S. labor market remains strong even in the face of stubbornly high inflation. Economists expect nonfarm payrolls grew by 225,000 last month with the unemployment rate expected to hold steady at 3.4%, according to data from Bloomberg. The BLS will release its latest jobs figures at 8:30 a.m. ET. Here are the key figures investors will be looking for in Friday's report compared to January's figures, according to data from Bloomberg: Nonfarm payrolls: +225,000 vs. +517,000 Unemployment rate: 3.4% vs. 3.4% Average hourly earnings, month-on-month: +0.3% vs. +0.3% Average hourly earnings, year-on-year: +4.7% vs. +4.4% Labor force participation rate: 62.4% vs. 62.4% Average weekly hours worked: 34.6 vs. 34.7 Investors will be paying particularly close attention to revisions to January's data released Friday morning, as investors saw the unexpectedly strong 517,000 jobs created to start the year as a potential outgrowth of seasonal adjustment factors or favorable weather. ""Given the potential impact of weather and seasonality effects in January there is the possibility of another shock last month, albeit mainly to the downside this time,"" wrote Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients earlier this month. Ashworth expects job gains in February will tally 200,000 just below consensus estimates. Friday's report also comes less than two weeks before the Federal Reserve's next policy meeting, with markets now expecting the central bank will raise interest rates by a more aggressive 0.50%. Fed Chair Jay Powell told lawmakers this week ""the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated."" Data from the CME Group shows markets pricing in an 60% of a 0.50% rate hike on March 22. An employment report that is in-line with expectations could clinch that more aggressive move later this month.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. For the last year, the Federal Reserve has tried to accomplish one goal, using one tool — lower inflation by raising interest rates. The result has been benchmark interest rates rising by 4.5% in a year and headline inflation falling from a peak of 9.1% in June to 6.4% as of January. As Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated in testimony on Capitol Hill this week, there is still work to be done for the Fed to achieve its goal. But over the last week, acute challenges at two banks have surfaced another issue now facing the Powell Fed. And that is the stability of the financial system. On Wednesday, Silvergate Capital (SI), which had become one of the crypto industry's biggest banking partners, announced it will liquidate and wind down operations after suffering significant deposit outflows from its digital asset clients. That same day, Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB), the preferred banking partner of the venture and startup worlds, announced it would take a $1.8 billion loss while liquidating its entire short-term securities book and raising $2.25 billion fresh capital. In a letter to investors, CEO Greg Becker assured investors the bank had ""ample liquidity,"" and said it took these actions ""because we expect continued higher interest rates, pressured public and private markets, and elevated cash burn levels from our clients as they invest in their businesses."" The Information reported Thursday afternoon Becker told investors on a call, ""I would ask everyone to stay calm and to support us just like we supported you during the challenging times."" Few statements have a tougher audience than investors being told to remain calm in times of market stress. On Thursday, U.S. stocks got crushed during a steady, relentless sell-off that centered on the financial sector. Regional banks were hammered. Big banks were hammered. The S&P 500 fell 1.8%. Bitcoin fell 7%. The challenge for Powell, however, is that some of the stress facing Silicon Valley Bank has been induced by the Fed's actions to fight inflation. And the fear is they may not be alone. In the simplest terms, Silicon Valley Bank took a nearly $2 billion hit selling bonds at a loss to buy different bonds that offer a higher yield. The firm's latest annual report showed the bank owned about $14 billion in Treasury securities with an average maturity between 1-5 years. Today, 1-year Treasury bills yield 5.25%. One day's drop in the stock market, of course, is not cause for concern about the financial system. Even the liquidation of one bank and deep investor concerns about another need not constitute a Fed-level worry about the U.S. banking system. But these moves serve as reminders that while the central bank's role in raising or lowering interest rates has become the focal point of investor attention over the last decade, the Fed also serves the central role in stabilizing markets and quelling investor fears during uncertain moments like the present. Almost exactly three years ago, Powell held an emergency Sunday night call on March 15, 2020 to announce a series of measures aimed at supporting the economy as the pandemic rapidly shut down global business. On that call, Powell reminded the assembled press, ""[That] central banks were originally designed to ...provide liquidity to financial systems in stress, so we take that job very seriously. It's probably the most important thing we're doing now is that."" Rising anxiety in the banking system as the ripples from a crypto collapse in 2022 and the icing over of a red hot venture market pale in comparison to the financial emergency the Fed faced three years ago. But their actions then were a reminder of the central bank's power, and, indeed, its centrality to financial markets. When the February jobs report is released Friday morning, investors will pore over the data to decipher whether a 0.25% or 0.50% rate hike from the Fed is likely warranted on March 22. This is the moment markets have been building towards for weeks. But the unforeseen stress now being injected into the banking system makes Friday and the days ahead notable for the Fed in an entirely different manner. That presents to Jay Powell another wrinkle in the challenge of trying to bring order to an economy that busted and boomed in a few short months.

2023-03-10,tsla,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/why-silicon-valley-banks-crisis-is-rattling-americas-biggest-banks-121159393.html,"The problems of two small banks on the West Coast are rippling across markets and causing new investor concerns about some of the country’s largest financial institutions. Why? Three words: rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve’s aggressive campaign to bring down inflation helped set the stage for major problems at two California lending institutions — SVB Financial (SIVB) and Silvergate Capital (SI) — as an outflow of deposits forced both to sell assets at a loss. Those assets were bonds. Banks are big investors in assets like Treasury bills because they need lots of safe places to park their cash. Many financial institutions piled into these investments during a period of historically-low interest rates that spanned the early years of the pandemic, as banks took in tons of new deposits and lending was somewhat restrained. But now the Fed is hiking rates at a rapid clip, with Fed Chair Jay Powell warning earlier this week the central bank may have to speed up the pace of its rate increases to cool the economy further. The problem that creates for banks is simple: higher rates lower the value of their existing bonds. The withdrawals at SVB's Silicon Valley Bank have come from startups and technology firms, many of which also ran into new trouble once the Fed began raising rates. The deposit outflow forced SVB to sell assets and take a $1.8 billion loss, a move the bank it made “because we expect continued higher interest rates, pressured public and private markets, and elevated cash-burn levels from our clients as they invest in their businesses.” Its shares fell more than 60% Thursday. In pre-market trade on Friday SVB shares were down another 60% after overnight reporting from Bloomberg said VC firms ranging from Peter Thiel's Founder Fund to Union Square Ventures had told portfolio companies to pull their money from Silicon Valley Bank. Banks don't have to realize losses on bonds that may have gone down in value amid rising rates if they're not pushed to sell these assets. But Silvergate Capital and SVB Financial didn’t have that choice. Customer withdrawals at Silvergate Bank and SVB’s Silicon Valley Bank forced their hand. At Silvergate, which caters to cryptocurrency clients, customers yanked their money in the panic that followed the 2022 collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Silvergate said in January that it had realized losses of $886 million from selling securities as deposits fell. That weakened the bank considerably. On Wednesday it said it would wind down its bank, and its shares plunged Thursday. After disclosing the $1.8 billion loss and new capital raise, Silicon Valley’s CEO Greg Becker urged calm in a call with venture capitalists Thursday, according to The Information, asking these investors not to withdraw money. It now is seeking to raise $2.25 billion of new capital to cover the new losses. The concern now among investors is that much bigger banks could be forced to do the same. That sent the stocks of giant financial institutions tumbling Thursday, including the biggest of the big: JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC). A major bank index fell by the most Thursday in nearly three years. The biggest U.S. banks are much stronger than they were in the lead up to the last big banking crisis, in 2008, in part because regulators forced them to hold more capital and survive numerous stress test scenarios over the last decade and a half. And the giants have more diverse funding and customer bases than banks such as Silicon Valley or Silvergate, which gives them many more options during challenging times. Longtime banking analyst Mike Mayo said Thursday during an appearance on CNBC the biggest banks are ""a pillar of strength and stability"" and much more resilient than they were prior to the 2008 crisis. ""The biggest risks are outside the largest banks,"" he said, and yet all banks are ""getting painted with the same brush."" Bank stocks, he said, ""have gotten Powelled,"" referring to the Fed chair. ""Going from zero to 5% interest rates in a period that is faster than any time in four decades, you are going to have casualties."" Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chair Martin Gruenberg highlighted the new interest rate risks facing the industry during a speech on March 6, noting that unrealized losses on available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities totaled $620 billion at the end of 2022 across all U.S. banks. ""The current interest rate environment has had dramatic effects on the profitability and risk profile of banks’ funding and investment strategies,"" he said. ""First, as a result of the higher interest rates, longer term maturity assets acquired by banks when interest rates were lower are now worth less than their face values. The result is that most banks have some amount of unrealized losses on securities."" These unrealized losses, he added, ""weaken a bank’s future ability to meet unexpected liquidity needs."" The good news, according to Gruenberg, is that ""banks are generally in a strong financial condition, and have not been forced to realize losses by selling depreciated securities.""

2023-03-09,tsla,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-today-live-updates-march-9-2023-135006552.html,"Stocks got crushed on Thursday as worries rippled through the banking sector and investors remained on edge ahead of a crucial February jobs report slated for Friday morning. At the closing bell, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down 1.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was off by 1.6%, or 542 points, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down by 2%. Through Thursday's close the market was on pace for its worst week of the year, Bloomberg data showed. The selling on Thursday accelerated throughout the trading session as a collapse in shares of SVB Financial (SIVB) pressured bank stocks and raised concerns over previously unforeseen knock-on effects from the Federal Reserve's rate hiking campaign on the financial system. On Wednesday, SVB announced a $2.25 billion capital raise and the sale of nearly all of its securities portfolio for a loss of $1.8 billion. The company's Silicon Valley Bank subsidiary is the bank for many startups and other players in the venture world. In a letter to investors on Wednesday, the company said: ""We are taking these actions because we expect continued higher interest rates, pressured public and private markets, and elevated cash burn levels from our clients as they invest in their businesses."" The Information reported Thursday afternoon Greg Becker, CEO of Silicon Valley Bank, said on a call with investors, ""I would ask everyone to stay calm and to support us just like we supported you during the challenging times."" Becker also reportedly told investors the bank has ""ample liquidity,"" but said that ""if everyone is telling each other SVB is in trouble, that would be a challenge."" SVB shares fell 60% on Thursday. This decline also weighed on regional banks, with the SPDR Regional Banking ETF (KRE) falling 8% while the SPDR Financial Sector ETF (XLF) fell some 4%. Among major U.S. money-center banks, shares of JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), and Wells Fargo (WFC) were all down more than 5% on Thursday. First Republic Bank (FRC), which maintains a large high net-worth clients business, saw shares fall 16% during Thursday's trading session. As Bloomberg's Jonathan Ferro tweeted, Thursday seems to have marked the moment in the rate-hiking cycle that higher rates are good for banks until they are no longer good. Earlier Thursday, labor market data had been the main catalyst for the market as investors await a crucial jobs report set for release Friday morning. The weekly report on initial filings for unemployment insurance Thursday morning showed 211,000 claims were filed last week, an increase of 21,000 from the prior weak and what economists at Oxford Economics called the ""first hint of weakness"" in this data. ""The jump in jobless claims to 211k last week from 190k is the first sign of weakness in the claims data this year but is still well short of the 300k+ level that would be consistent with a recession,"" Michael Pearce, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients. ""As the Fed presses ahead with more rate hikes, we expect layoffs to eventually rise significantly."" The initial pop from stocks following this data came after two days of testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made clear interest rates are likely to go higher than expected amid strong labor market and inflation data. Stocks finished Wednesday's trading session mixed after a sell-off Tuesday that was triggered by comments from Powell suggesting the Fed will need to raise rates higher than previously forecasted amid stubborn inflation. ""I was surprised by Powell's willingness to accelerate the policy tightening pace, but I am not surprised by the admission that terminal rates will need to rise further,"" said Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro. ""At present, the futures market is priced for a [50 basis point] move in March. There is no point cracking open a door if you don’t intend to walk through."" Data from the CME Group shows markets placing an 80% on the Fed raising rates by 0.50% later this month. Elsewhere in markets, WTI crude oil fell about 1.5% to trade near $75.50 a barrel, a retreat from the $80 a barrel oil was trading near earlier this week. Investors were also keeping a close eye on the Treasury market with the 10-year yield firmer by about 5 basis points, trading at 3.92% after a move higher in yields earlier this week led to a deepening inversion of the yield curve. In single-stock news, shares of Silvergate (SI) were in focus on Thursday after the bank said late Wednesday it would liquidate and wind down its operations after suffering heavy losses amid huge deposit outflows from its digital asset client base. Shares of Silvergate, which have lost more than 95% over the last year, fell 41% on Thursday. Other stocks on the move on Thursday included MongoDB (MDB), which fell 8.3% following a disappointing quarterly report.

2023-03-09,tsla,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/banks-tumble-svb-ignites-broader-173433069.html,"By Sinéad Carew (Reuters) - The S&P 500 bank index tumbled nearly 6% on Thursday in its biggest one-day drop in over two years as investors fled the industry following SVB Financial Group's share sale announcement and crypto bank Silvergate's decision to wind down operations. Shares of SVB, whose operating segments include Silicon Valley Bank, slumped over 50% in their deepest one-day drop on record after the company announced a $1.75 billion share sale late on Wednesday. SVB is battling cash burn due to declining deposits from startups struggling with a venture capital funding drought. San Francisco headquartered First Republic slumped 15% after hitting its lowest level since October 2020. The SPDR S&P regional banking ETF dropped more than 7% to its lowest level since January 2021. Major U.S. banks were also hit, with JPMorgan and Bank of America both down more than 5%. First Republic and SVB were the S&P 500's deepest percentage decliners in Thursday's trading session, while JPMorgan's loss weighed more than any other stock on the S&P 500's 1.1% decline at mid-day. ""The Silicon Valley raise got everybody nervous about people's capital levels and what deposits are doing. A lot of institutional investors don't feel great about owning certain banks right now,"" said R.J. Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. ""It just gets people freaked out because Silicon Valley, historically has been a very strong, well-run bank. If they're having issues right now, people are wondering what about other banks that are lesser quality and that don't have the reputation that Silicon Valley Bank has."" Investors were also grappling with the decline of cryptocurrency-focused lender Silvergate Capital, which dropped 22% after saying late on Thursday it planned to wind down operations and voluntarily liquidate after it was hit with losses following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. Shares in Silvergate peer Signature bank fell 9.4%.

2023-03-09,tsla,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/mortgage-rates-increase-again-flirt-with-7-170227323.html,"Mortgage rates surged higher this week, closing in on 7%, further cementing affordability concerns in the housing market. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage increased to 6.73% from 6.65% the week prior, according to Freddie Mac. Rates have climbed nearly three-quarters of a point since the beginning of February. The jump in rates continued to fuel the standoff between price-struck homebuyers and hesitant sellers, as elevated home prices weigh on already weak demand ahead of the spring season. Add to that the expectation that rates could soon crest 7% if inflation remains a top concern. “It's not just higher mortgage rates, but really the combination of higher mortgage rates and still higher home prices in most markets that are creating hurdles for buyers,” Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale, told Yahoo Finance. “Even though a greater share of home sellers in today's market have adjusted their price lower, both listing and sale prices have continued to climb on a year-over-year basis.” While the volume of applications to purchase a home increased by 7% for the week ending March 3, overall purchase activity was 42% lower than a year ago, the Mortgage Bankers Association latest survey found. “Even with this jump in activity, both purchase and refinance applications remain well below year-ago levels when rates were much lower,” MBA President and CEO Bob Broeksmit told Yahoo Finance. “The recent increase in mortgage rates, right at the start of the busy spring buying season, could cause prospective buyers to delay decisions until rates moderate.” Buyers still in the market also have to contend with higher list prices from sellers. The national median listing price increased to $415,000 in February, Realtor.com data showed, up from $406,000 the previous month and up 7.8% year over year. That reverses several months of softening listing prices after peaking in June at $449,000, and could suggest that sellers are getting stubborn in offering incentives. Without wiggle room on prices, buyers are seeing their purchasing power evaporate amid rising interest rates. For instance, the monthly mortgage payment for a median-priced home is 49% higher than a year ago at last week’s rate of 6.65%, according to Realtor.com. Buyers are likely to face further affordability challenges entering the spring, Hale noted, because too-low inventory will continue to buoy home prices. “One big reason that home prices continue to climb is that even though we have more homes for sale today, the market is still not back to what was common before the pandemic in most places,” Hale said. “And fewer homes for sale mean there's still some pressure on prices even though buyers are more selective amid higher costs.” As homebuyer demand remains weak, home sellers are feeling more pessimistic and are much less active than last year. There were 15.9% fewer homes listed for sale in February compared with last year, data from Realtor.com showed. Meanwhile, there’s some evidence that sellers are a bit less generous with buyer incentives. For instance, 57% of builders used incentives to close sales in February, the National Association of Home Builders said, down from 62% in December and 59% in November. A growing share of sellers are also pulling back on price reductions, more so than what is typical during this time of the year. According to Realtor.com, 13% of home sellers issued a price cut in February, up from 5.4% a year ago. Still, in January at least 15.3% of sellers lowered their prices to make a sale. Mortgage rates have been marching higher since February after government data revealed the inflation remains a threat. This week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell made it clear to Congress that he isn’t ready to soften his aggressive fight on inflation, indicating that further rate hikes would likely be necessary as we enter the spring. That could likely keep mortgage rates higher. Though “forecasting is far more art than science,” Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com, anticipates that mortgage rates are likely to climb higher before they retreat later this year. “At present, and while there is a chance that rates could retreat to recent bottom levels or perhaps a little below at some point, much depends on what happens with prices, with the Fed, and ultimately whether or not the economy gets to a tipping point and starts to head into recession,” Gumbinger recently told Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-09,tsla,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/9-ways-biden-is-set-to-raise-some-taxes-in-2024-budget-proposal-145357176.html,"President Biden is set to lay out vast and expensive ambitions in his 2024 budget Thursday from shoring up Medicare and boosting domestic spending to reducing the deficit by nearly $3 trillion over the coming decade. To pay for it all, he plans to propose a slate of tax increases, according to multiple peeks at the budget administration officials gave in recent days. There are new taxes on the business world focused on raising the rate on corporate income and on stock buybacks. He will also propose new taxes on wealthy Americans — from changes to how investment income is taxed to a revival of his ""billionaire minimum tax"" on wealth. “I want to make it clear I’m going to raise some taxes,” President Biden said during a recent stop in Virginia, offering one of his many previews of what's to come. Of course, presidential budget proposals are largely symbolic documents that are more about staking out a position rather than being enacted. But they serve as an important marker of Biden’s priorities for the year ahead. “What the president has really here to use is the bully pulpit, meaning once he puts his budget forward, is he going to continue to push some of those ideas?” asked Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget President Maya MacGuineas in a Yahoo Finance Live interview on Wednesday. “If he's serious about it, he'll push it.” Here are some of the new taxes set to be unveiled on Thursday In his budget, President Biden is set to renew his long-standing calls for more taxes on Corporate America. Included in a New York Times preview of the budget document are Biden’s desire to raise the corporate income tax rate to 28% from its current level of 21%. The president is also set to renew his call to quadruple the recently enacted excise tax on stock buybacks, a change he first offered earlier this year during his State of the Union address. On Jan. 1, a new 1% tax on share repurchases went into effect, but has done little to damp business enthusiasm for the practice. The provision is currently set to bring in about $74 billion over the coming decade, and Biden is proposing to increase the rate to 4%. And according to a document reviewed by Reuters, the budget will also propose scrapping tax breaks that oil and gas companies receive. That could likely open up another front in the back and forth between the White House and oil companies over record profits they've enjoyed since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The new proposals come after last year’s Inflation Reduction Act imposed multiple new taxes on businesses, including the 1% stock buyback excise tax and a new corporate book minimum tax. Going after more taxes so shortly after last year's victory likely will inflame critics. Erica York, a senior economist at the Tax Foundation, argued in an interview Wednesday with Yahoo Finance that Biden’s policies were already “heading in the wrong direction and the president's budget is going to double down on that.” “I would say wait and see how it plays out before you double down or quadruple down on it,” she added. Biden is also set to propose new taxes on Americans making over $400,000 a year. The president rolled out his most controversial proposal during this year’s State of the Union with a potential new tax that would target wealth, not just income. “We have to reward work, not just wealth,” President Biden said in his speech. “No billionaire should be paying a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter.” According to a preview offered to Bloomberg, the president will lay out new details on that, including a call for a 25% minimum tax on households worth more than $100 million as well as an increase in the capital gains rate for wealthy Americans. Other tax ideas that were present in previous budgets are set to be revived for 2024, including ending the so-called carried-interest loophole and eliminating some tax breaks around real-estate profits. All told, the various increases would fund nearly $3 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade and also fund other Biden priorities. The deficit reduction will come in a budget that “achieves this while lowering costs for families, investing in America, and protecting programs Americans have paid into because it proposes tax reforms to ensure the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share, while cutting wasteful spending on special interests — interests like Big Oil and Big Pharma,” Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Wednesday. Finally, the White House previewed new taxes to shore up the Medicare program earlier this week. Biden will propose increases on payroll taxes on Americans making over $400,000 per year; closing loopholes that shields some “pass-through” income from Medicare taxes; and allowing Medicare to negotiate on a wider array of prescription drugs. Those provisions, which Biden reviewed in a New York Times op-ed on Tuesday, would extend the program through 2050. Critics have noted that many of these proposals would be untested ways to fund the health care program for retirees. York also noted that some of the rule changes around the net investment income tax would help Medicare's finances by diverting some money from the government’s general fund. “Of course that looks like you're strengthening Medicare, but you're creating a hole in the budget elsewhere,” she said, noting the plan also increases the net investment income tax from 3.8% to 5% and would therefore also bring in more money overall. Republicans have been promising for weeks that Biden’s proposals won’t see the light of day. This is hardly new — there's an old saying in Washington about budgets that “the president proposes and Congress disposes” — but it will nevertheless increase pressure on House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) to offer his own proposal in the coming months. MacGuineas, who previewed the dueling proposals, noted that the White House budget will likely focus on tax increases and the GOP plan will revolve around spending cuts. “Neither of them is realistic, and, frankly, neither of them is the right policy,” she said. “We need compromises on both.” Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. Fed chair Jay Powell just poured cold water on the ""no landing"" crowd hoping to avert a U.S. recession and rally stocks to fresh record highs this year. After two days of grilling before Congress, investors have been reminded (again) that the Fed chief still sees inflation as a persistent, pernicious threat. Stocks and bonds took notice Wednesday, as both sold off amid surging short-term rates — leaving the major indices underwater for the week as of the close. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes,"" said Powell before the Senate. And with two weeks to go until the next Fed meeting, markets are now expecting exactly that. Bonds and derivatives are pricing in a more hawkish outcome — expecting the Fed to lift its benchmark rate 50 basis points instead of 25 basis points. Since Monday's settlement, the U.S. 2-year Treasury-Note yield has surged 18 basis points to 5.06% — the highest level since 2007. It also deepened its inversion over the 10-year yield, with the spread reaching negative 108 basis points (or -1.08 percentage points) — the highest since the early 1980s when Paul Volcker was the Fed chair fighting a similar battle over price inflation. Under normal conditions, interest rates of longer-term loans or bonds (the cost of money) are expected to be more expensive than their shorter-term counterparts, as risk is higher on the long end. But this changes when the Fed starts stamping out animal spirits, lifting short-term rates to restrict the creation of credit and eventually choke off growth. While the magnitude, or depth, of a yield curve inversion isn't necessarily predictive of a deeper, or longer recession, there are a host of other indicators in the bond market that are sounding alarm bells. Former bond trader and CEO of TheMacroCompass.com Alfonso Peccatiello recently joined Yahoo Finance Live to offer his insights. Peccatiello notes that the bond market expects the Fed to fight inflation and remain tight, with interest rates well over 5% a year from now. ""That cannot happen if a recession is unfolding. The Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates,"" he said. Essentially, the inflation-fighting credibility that Powell has earned in the markets comes with a cost — pushing expectations of Fed capitulation far beyond what occurs historically. ""The issue is — the tighter you keep borrowing conditions for the private sector, the higher you keep mortgage rates, the higher you keep corporate borrowing rates — the higher the chances you're going to freeze these credit markets and basically sleepwalk into an accident or, in general, accelerate a recession later on,"" said Peccatiello. But long before the Fed delivers relief in the form of cuts, Peccatiello expects stocks to suffer from an earnings recession, which, he says, ""isn't fully priced in."" (An earnings recession — marked by two consecutive quarterly declines in S&P 500 earnings — often, but not always precedes an economic recession.) Peccatiello believes the U.S. is already in an earnings recession, with stocks reflecting complacency. Nevertheless, he doesn't expect a disaster. He sees about 10% maximum downside risk in the S&P 500 down to the 3600 level, which is right around last year's lows. ""I don't think it's going to be much lower than that,"" he says, adding, ""[T]he stock market generally bottoms before earnings bottom."" The reason gets back to the Fed, which historically capitulates and slashes rates as earnings drop. The Fed rate cuts then get incorporated into better stock valuations, which eventually halt the decline in stock prices, Peccatiello added. ""[This] means the stock market can stop its decline and start slowly but surely moving into a new bull market.""

""We have not made any decision,"" he told the House Financial Services Committee, saying key reports on employment and inflation would govern any moves. The remarks came a day after he told the Senate Banking Committee that, ""we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes"" if the data supported it. That spurred traders to price in a higher chance of a 0.50% hike than a 0.25% increase later this month. “We're going to be looking at the totality of data,"" Powell said Wednesday during questioning from House members. ""We are not on a preset path,"" he added. Powell said the Fed wants to see the upcoming employment report Friday, along with key inflation reports on the consumer and producer price indexes, before making a judgment. On Wednesday, the Dow dropped 0.18%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.14%, and the Nasdaq rose 0.40%. When asked by Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D, Mass.) whether the Fed would pause interest rates to avoid a recession, the chairman called it a serious question and noted that he wouldn’t say yes or no. The Fed, he said, is not ""seeking a recession."" Powell also said the era of low interest rates is likely over. ""Now, we have the 10-year [Treasury yield] back close to 4%,"" said Powell. ""And I think, we need to be careful not to assume that these secular low, longer term rates, will continue indefinitely because it doesn't look likely now."" Democrats, including Democratic Ranking Member Maxine Waters (D, CA) asked him to comment on the prospect of a U.S. default if Congress is not able to raise the debt ceiling. Powell warned that the Fed can’t protect the economy from brinksmanship or a default. ""No one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the non-payment of the government's bills, let alone a debt default, which I don't think will happen, but no one should think we have the tools to protect against the effects of that,"" said Powell. When asked whether the Fed would accept a trillion-dollar coin to avoid a debt default, Powell said there are no rabbits to be pulled out of hats and that would be a ""rabbit coming out of a hat."" House Republicans expressed concerns about reviewing and potentially increasing capital requirements for banks. Patrick McHenry, the chairman of the House committee, questioned the motivation of a ""holistic review"" of these requirements from the Fed’s Vice Chair of Supervision Michael Barr, saying the Fed shouldn’t operate in the shadows when the regulation in question can have broad and significant economic effects. McHenry also accused the Fed of laying the groundwork for a new climate policy. ""The Fed needs to stick to its knitting,"" said McHenry. ""I agree there is concern for many that the Fed is picking up new needles and knitting partisan sweaters at such a precarious time for our economy here at home in the global economy. That would be a mistake."" Powell’s comments Wednesday were his last before the Fed’s policy meeting in two weeks.

2023-03-08,tsla,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-march-8-2023-124051164.html,"U.S. stocks finished mixed on Wednesday, following two job prints that showed the labor market remains tight amid sticky inflation. Wall Street also heard from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday morning. Powell continued to stress that ""no decision"" has been made on the size of the Fed's upcoming interest-rate increase at its March policy meeting. ""When say we will look at the totality of data, that will include these next reports. We will carefully analyze. Haven't made a decision on the March meeting. Larger point is that we are not on a preset path,"" said Powell during his second day of testimony before Congress. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended the day up 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined by 0.2%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added 0.4%. Bond yields inched higher alongside a stronger dollar. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked up to 3.98% Wednesday. U.S. stocks plummeted Tuesday after Powell said during his Senate Banking Committee testimony that interest rates may rise “higher” than previously expected as the Fed continues a persistent fight against inflation. Powell’s comments on Capitol Hill triggered a 1.5% selloff in equities, according to JP Morgan’s trading desk. Tuesday’s losses saw every sector lower, with financials and real estate logging the biggest declines for the day. Treasury yields were higher, with the 2-year yield tipping above 5%, while the spread between the 10-year and 2-year US Treasury yields inverted for the first time since September 1981. According to strategists at Deutsche Bank, reaching this level signals a recession could be underway or has occurred within a maximum of eight months. “Powell’s speech indicates that the Fed will heavily depend on near-term data for upcoming rates decisions,” Michael Feroli, Chief U.S. Economist at JP Morgan, wrote in a note Wednesday morning. ""With January’s macro data mostly printing on the hawkish side, NFP Friday and CPI next Tuesday are the most critical catalysts for Fed’s decision between 25bp and 50bp,” Feroli added. Still, on the economic data side, ADP’s monthly read on private payroll growth rose by 242,000 in February, above consensus expectations for 200,000. ADP also tracked pay growth for those workers who stayed in their position, which decelerated to 7.2% last month, the slowest pace of gains within in the last year. “There is a tradeoff in the labor market right now,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist, ADP, wrote in the press release. ""We're seeing robust hiring, which is good for the economy and workers, but pay growth is still quite elevated. The modest slowdown in pay increases, on its own, is unlikely to drive down inflation rapidly in the near term.” Meanwhile, the U.S. monthly international trade deficit increased to $68.3 billion in January, below the consensus deficit of $68.7 billion as imports increased more than exports, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the U.S. Census Bureau. Another highlight Wednesday morning was January’s report on the number of job openings, which fell to 10.82 million, down from the upwardly revised 11.2 million openings in the prior month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. The construction, leisure, hospitality, and finance industries showed significant pullbacks in job openings. ""While the January JOLTS report shows job openings are heading in the right direction for the Fed, the decline is far too modest to convince that labor market conditions are cooling enough to bring down inflation,"" Matthew Martin, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a statement following the release. February’s jobs report out on Friday will hold more clues about the strength of the economy. Economists expect 215,000 new jobs will be added to the economy, a slower pace than January’s blowout number of 517,000 job additions. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.4%. Another key point from the reading will be wage growth, with a 0.3% month-to-month bump in average hourly earnings anticipated and 4.7% over the last year. In single-stock moves, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) gained over 2% Wednesday after a regulatory filing revealed that Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway bought nearly 6 million shares of the oil company in recent days, raising its stake in the company to 200.2 million shares worth $12.2 billion. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD) shares rose 3% Wednesday after the security software provider reported fourth-quarter earnings that topped analysts' expectations and issued stronger guidance for the fiscal first quarter. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) dipped 3% as Berenberg analyst Adrian Yanoshik slashed his rating on the stock from buy to hold, citing ""based on misplaced fears of a price war – appears to have been accepted by the market,"" Yanoshik noted. Separately, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened an investigation into the Model Y SUV over a concern with its steering wheels. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-08,tsla,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/key-recession-indicator-yield-inversion-treasury-160255114.html,"The Treasury market is sending its sharpest warning about recession risks since 1981. On Tuesday, the difference in the yield on 2-year and 10-year Treasury notes further inverted, with the yield on the 10-year falling 103 basis points, or 1.03 percentage points, below the yield on the 2-year yield. This dynamic has preceded each of the last eight U.S. recessions. By this measure, the yield curve has been inverted since July of last year as investors bet aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve to combat inflation would tip the economy into recession. In an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled the central bank will likely be more aggressive than it previously forecast in raising interest rates this year as inflation proves stubborn and the labor market remains strong. ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,"" Powell told the Senate Banking Committee in prepared remarks. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes."" ""Although inflation has been moderating in recent months, the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy,"" Powell added. The Fed will announce its next policy decision on March 22, a statement that will also be accompanied by new projections on where Fed officials see interest rates headed over the rest of this year and the next two. Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients Tuesday that Powell ""opened the door for the central bank to accelerate the pace of rate hikes and raise the target range of the fed funds rate more than anticipated because of the recent hot data on job growth and inflation."" Sweet noted investors are now pricing in 100 basis points of additional rate hikes from the Fed this year, up from the 75 basis points previously expected by most economists. Data from the CME Group showed Wednesday morning markets are now pricing in a nearly 80% chance the Fed raises rates by 50 basis points, or 0.50%, at its meeting later this month. As Yahoo Finance's Brian Cheung noted last year, there is nothing about Treasury yields themselves, or the relationship between the yield at any two points along the curve, that signals recession. Rather, it is what yields imply about future interest rates — and in turn future economic growth — that offers worrying signs for investors. While it is hotly debated what, exactly, ""goes into"" the yield for any Treasury security, a simple axiom used by many investors says Treasury yields indicate what the expected average of the fed funds rate, or the Fed's benchmark interest rate, will be over a given time period. With the 2-year yield standing at around 5% as of Wednesday morning, this implies investors think the fed funds rate will be, on average, 5% over the next two years. Today, the fed funds rate stands at roughly 4.6%, as the Fed's target interest rate range is 4.5%-4.75% following its decision last month to raise rates an additional 25 basis points. Therefore, we can say investors are anticipating the Fed will raise rates to at least 5% and keep them there for two years, or raise rates above 5% for some period of time before cutting them such that the average Fed funds rate is 5%. Duke professor Campbell Harvey, who uncovered this ""recession indicator"" in the 1980s, told Bloomberg in an interview earlier this year he thinks the economy can avoid recession despite warnings coming from his work. In part, in Harvey's view, this is because market awareness of this indicator has lessened its potency as a predictive measure. Notably, Harvey's worked actually focused on the spread between the 3-month Treasury bill and the 10-year Treasury note as the most potent recession indicator, not the now-popular 2-year/10-year spread. The spread between these two tenors along the curve currently stands at minus 107 basis points, still a clear recession signal by Harvey's work.

In exchange for capturing this difference between the wholesale and retail cost of goods, retailers take on the financial risk of fronting money to one party while working to make it back and then some from another. At the scale of the U.S. consumer economy, the differences between an additional week in a quarter, an additional weekend in a month, or even an additional day in a year can be millions of dollars or more. And if the timing of a day or two can disrupt the financial fortunes of a business — meaning there can be just hours between profits and losses — then one can imagine the challenges faced by retailers during the supply chain disruptions that results from the pandemic. In 2021, the story was that retailers were unable to match consumer demand as the economy re-opened. In 2022, supply chains that got unstuck eventually left retailers with more stock than they needed. As 2023 gets underway, retailers are suggesting the balance may finally be just right. Sporting goods retailer Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) reported fourth quarter results Tuesday morning that impressed investors, with shares rising 11% after the company offered a full-year earnings forecast well above expectations. And driving this profit forecast were inventories that are in ""great shape"" ahead of the company's busy spring season. ""As planned, we continued to address targeted inventory overages, and as a result our inventory is in great shape as we start 2023. We couldn't be more excited about our spring assortment,"" said Lauren Hobart, president and CEO. Dick's CFO Navdeep Gupta added on a call with analysts Tuesday morning, ""We were chasing inventory last year amidst industry-wide supply chain disruptions. ...Compared to Q4 of 2019, a 38% increase in sales was well ahead of our 29% increase in inventory. Our inventory is healthy and well positioned."" Looking at economy-wide data, we can see inventory-to-sales levels are still depressed relative to pre-pandemic levels. Though this measure is in part driven by strong sales, which keeps the ratio of inventories to sales low. Still, comments from Dick's were the latest echo of a refrain heard often from the industry as retail results have poured in over the last few weeks. And that refrain says the industry is finally finding something like a ""normal"" setting after three pandemic-altered years. Back in late February, Walmart (WMT) CEO Doug McMillon said his team, ""acted quickly and aggressively to address the inventory and cost challenges we faced last year."" ""We ended the quarter with inventory about flat to last year which is better than we anticipated and even better when you consider how inflation lifts that number,"" McMillon added on a call with analysts. ""And [we] did it while improving in-stock levels."" McMillon added: ""And so as we look at where we are today with much better position around inventory...I feel like this year will be more of a normal environment for markdowns or certainly more normal than what it was last year."" The company did, however, say there was ""work to be done"" on its apparel inventory levels. But clothing retailers Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN) both indicated in their latest reports inventory levels continue to improve. ""Despite an increasingly volatile macroeconomic climate, through the ongoing execution of our Polaris strategy, we remained agile, pivoted to meet customer demand and elevated our approach to inventory management,” said Jeff Gennette, Macy's chairman and CEO. ""In the fourth quarter, we benefited from our disciplined inventory approach."" The company reported inventory levels that were down 3% from last year and said, ""Inventory productivity continues to be a focus for the company in 2023 and beyond."" Nordstrom, for its part, said inventory levels were down 15% from last year and at levels similar to those that prevailed in 2019, the last year before the pandemic. ""We took decisive actions to right-size our inventory as we entered the new year, positioning us for greater agility amidst continuing macroeconomic uncertainty,"" said CEO Erik Nordstrom.

Tuesday's losses saw the S&P 500 fall by the most in two weeks and trade back below the key 4,000 level. The index also broke its 50-day moving average, an indicator traders closely watch for signs stocks are breaking from recent trends. ""Fed Chair Jerome Powell confirmed today that interest rates are set to rise higher than we previously anticipated,"" wrote Andrew Hunter, deputy chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. ""But with most evidence still pointing to economic weakness and markedly lower inflation this year, we still believe the Fed will begin cutting rates again sooner than markets are expecting."" Powell delivered the first of his two days of semi-annual testimony to Congress on Tuesday, speaking before the Senate Banking Committee ahead of Wednesday's appearance before the House Financial Services Committee. In his prepared testimony released Tuesday, Powell spoke of a sustained central bank campaign to rein in inflation. ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,"" Powell said. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes."" Answering questions from lawmakers, Powell said the full impacts of the Fed's interest rate increases haven't yet been felt in the economy. Markets have begun to price in at least two additional 0.25% rate hikes from the central bank over its next two meetings; investors began the year with optimism the Fed would stop its rate-hiking campaign as soon as February. Powell's comments Tuesday opened the door to the possibility of both a higher terminal federal funds rate, as well as a higher pace of increases. According to data from CME Group, Powell's comments spurred traders to price in a higher chance of a 0.50% hike than a 0.25% increase later this month. The Fed will kick off its next two-day policy meeting in two weeks, with a policy announcement set for the afternoon of March 22. Elsewhere in markets, WTI crude oil was under pressure, falling more than 3.7% to around $77.40 per barrel.

U.S. stocks were trading lower Tuesday as some analysts said the comments were more hawkish than expected. Near 2:20 p.m. ET, the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) was near session lows, falling 1.5%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) off 1.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) falling 1.2%. ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,"" Powell told the Senate Banking Committee in prepared remarks.

""Although inflation has been moderating in recent months, the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy,"" Powell added. The latest Consumer Price Index report released last month showed prices rose 6.4% over the prior year in January, a slowdown from last summer's peak inflation rate of 9.1% but still well above the Fed's 2% target. Powell's comments spurred traders to price in a higher chance of a 0.50% hike than a 0.25% increase later this month, according to data from CME Group. In a note, Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner said Powell’s remarks ""opened the door"" to a return of 0.50% hikes, ""If the incoming data flow warrants it."" If there are ""upside surprises"" in a jobs report this Friday from the Labor Department, that could ""drive a faster and longer tightening cycle,"" according to Zentner's note. The Fed projected at its December policy meeting interest rates would need to rise to a range of 5%-5.25% this year, though Powell's comments now suggest rates will need to eventually rise above this level. Following the Fed's February policy decision, the central bank's benchmark interest rate stands in a range of 4.5%-4.75%. Some Senate Democrats challenged Powell during Tuesday’s hearing, cautioning that his rate hikes could lead to job losses. Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown (D-OH) said there are other ways to bring down prices, citing the strengthening of supply chains, boosting of U.S. manufacturing and the rebuilding of infrastructure. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said if the central bank raises rates as much as planned, to 5%-5.25% excluding any further rate hikes Powell has now suggested above that level, unemployment would rise to 4.6%. That, she said, would cost two million people jobs. ""Chair Powell, if you could speak directly to the two million hardworking people who have decent jobs today, who you're planning to get fired over the next year, what would you say to them?"" Warren asked. Powell, in response, said: ""I would explain to people more broadly that inflation is extremely high and it's hurting the working people of this country badly. All of them, not just two million of them, but all of them are suffering under high inflation, and we are taking the only measures we have to bring inflation down."" In a hat tip to these concerns, Powell said in his prepared remarks that the Fed is ""acutely aware"" high inflation is causing ""significant hardship"" for Americans while also pledging to “stay the course until the job is done."" The Fed chair said Tuesday policymakers will continue to make decisions on a meeting by meeting basis. Powell noted that economic data from January on inflation, job growth, consumer spending, and manufacturing production have partly reversed course from the slowdown seen back in December. Powell attributed some of the softening to unseasonably warm weather in January, but cautioned that the ""breadth of the reversal"" suggests inflation is running higher than expected. He reiterated the Fed still needs to see a drop in services inflation excluding housing to bring inflation down, which is likely to require a weaker job market.

2023-03-07,tsla,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/heres-what-biden-wants-to-do-to-shore-up-medicare-135302609.html,"President Biden is set to formally release his 2024 budget proposal later this week and is already offering previews on what he plans to do with Medicare. In new details released Tuesday to keep the program afloat into the 2050s, Biden says he can extend the solvency of the program without any benefit cuts via three moves: an increase on the tax rate on both earned and unearned income above $400,000; the closing of loopholes that shields some “pass-through” income from Medicare taxes; and allowing Medicare to negotiate on a wider array of prescription drugs. And overall, the president is looking at least five different tax changes for wealthy Americans and corporations to pay for his myriad ideas — both for Medicare and his larger push to “invest in America” and pay down the deficit. And while the proposal isn’t likely to get a vote on Capitol Hill, it will serve as an important marker of Biden’s priorities. The early focus on Medicare — as well as Social Security — underlines just how “deeply embedded” the twin programs have become in Biden’s political identity, Alex Lawson, the executive director of a group called Social Security Works, recently noted in an interview. The president talks nearly every week about the program and also released a New York Times op-ed on the topic Tuesday morning. Defending the programs now “seems to be one of the defining characteristics of Biden-world,” Lawson added. What the White House appears to be doing with this week’s choreographed multi-day rollout — culminating in a formal unveiling on Thursday in Philadelphia — is an attempt to shape the conversation as both the debt ceiling fight heats up this summer and a likely Biden 2024 re-election campaign kicks off. In the op-ed released Tuesday morning, President Biden wrote that “Medicare is more than a government program. It’s the rock-solid guarantee that Americans have counted on to be there for them when they retire."" The issue is top of mind with a key Medicare trust fund likely to run low on funds as early as 2028, according to a recent government trustees report. Meanwhile, Social Security likely has the funds to continue paying out current benefits for only a few years longer, through 2034. Biden’s proposal would increase the Medicare tax rate from 3.8% to 5% on all income above $400,000. It would also target what is known as net investment income - an additional fee on the returns for high-income earners as well as “pass through” business for Americans above $400,000 per year. The White House aims to change the rules and close loopholes around that income, which it notes can be shielded from the taxes that fund the Medicare program because it is classified currently as “neither earned income nor investment income.” The proposal would close loopholes in that area and also change the government's rules to allow that money to be sent to Medicare’s crucial Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, President of the American Action Forum, noted in a Yahoo Finance Live interview on Tuesday that the net investment tax piece is ""really using a tool that has never been used in Medicare before [and] it's not a particularly good piece of tax policy."" Holtz-Eakin, a Republican and former director of the Congressional Budget Office, added that the way to get these programs under control fiscally is to control growth, and ""you can't tax your way out of this."" The budget will also propose savings via new prescription drug reforms by giving Medicare the authority to negotiate prices for additional higher-cost drugs. The White House estimates these changes will save $200 billion over the coming decade. “There are ways in which the program can be operated more efficiently,” said Paul Van de Water, a Medicare specialist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who also listed other options for the years ahead like lowering payment rates to healthcare providers and limiting payments to Medicare Advantage. But even with all that, “it's still going to be essential we think to raise additional revenues,” he said. Van de Water also noted that Biden has previously proposed changes to the net investment income tax during a previous budget proposal. Thursday’s release will be Biden’s third since taking office. Tuesday’s unveiling is just the first step in what is much more detail to come about Biden's ideas and how he’ll pay for it all. In a recent online video, Biden’s budget director, Shalanda Young, outlined the overall priorities, including expanding the economy, lowering costs, protecting Social Security and Medicare as well as reducing the deficit by $2 trillion over the coming decade. So what other tax increases could be proposed? Administration officials say that both wealthy Americans and corporations will be the focus. In his State of the Union, Biden called to quadruple the excise tax on stock buybacks and to institute a new ""billionaire minimum tax"" on wealth. Both appear set for repeat appearances on Thursday. The president could also call to raise the top corporate tax rate, which would come in addition to a corporate minimum tax instituted last year as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. While House Republicans have pledged that all tax increases are off the table and won't be considered in the House. But the move will increase the pressure on Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) to release his own plan, something he has promised is coming soon. What Speaker McCarthy has discussed in the past is creating the “path” to balance the budget. House Republicans have already floated some small-scale proposals — targeting things like Medicaid and what they term as “woke waste.” What’s unclear — and Democrats and some budget experts charge is impossible — is how that plan takes a significant bite out of the deficit if Social Security, Medicare, and tax increases are all off the table. “We’re not going to sit here and be lectured by those folks about fiscal responsibility,” Biden said recently in a preview of the likely debate to come, adding of the GOP, it will “be interesting to see what they want to cut and what their numbers add up to.” This post has been updated.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. When Fed Chair Jay Powell settles in for his semi-annual testimony to the Senate Banking Committee today, investors will be looking for confirmation that the central bank is going to keep raising interest rates for the next several meetings to fight inflation. Besides the ongoing debate about whether the Fed’s actions are going to send the U.S. economy into recession and stocks into a tailspin, there’s been one other important side effect: the bond market is the hottest it’s been in years. That’s newly true not just for institutional investors, but for retail traders as well. That’s because online trading of Treasuries is accessible at a critical mass for the first time with rates at these levels. It's never been easier to buy, be it directly via the Treasury Department, from the discount brokerages, or through ETFs. The repricing of rate expectations this year has sent yields on many Treasury notes and bonds to their highest in 15 years, with the 2-year, 10-year (TNX), and 30-year all yielding around 4%. It’s been a huge shift for fixed income. Besides institutional investors salivating over government and corporate debt, retail traders are so keen they've repeatedly crashed the TreasuryDirect website, which provides a conduit to Treasuries and I bonds. (The latter is an inflation-protected instrument that has both a fixed rate and one that changes with inflation). “For pretty much the entire decade, leading up to this year, when people asked about retail and fixed income, I could just simply say, ‘no one really cares.’ The past year, that has significantly changed,” Shawn Cruz, Head Trading Strategist at TD Ameritrade, told Yahoo Finance. Sales of Treasury bills – those with maturities of one year or less – through TreasuryDirect were $12.0 billion in January, a record. Before last August, that number hadn’t cracked $5 billion. Net sales of I bonds were $4.2 billion in January, after spiking to $6.8 billion last October. Salim Ramji, Global Head of iShares and Index Investments at BlackRock, was enthusiastic about fixed income when he recently spoke to Yahoo Finance: “It’s a great time for investors to look for yield, but they don’t have to take the kind of risk that they might have two, three, four years ago, because you can get 4% yields in Treasuries. You can get 5% yields in investment grade, even at the front end.” BlackRock, as the largest provider of ETFs by assets, has benefited from the boom. Thus far in 2023, investors have poured $9.9 billion into U.S. iShares fixed income ETFs. And not all investors are going long; the firm’s most popular instrument in February in the category was the iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF (SHV). How long will the party last? Even if the Fed raises interest rates at its next three meetings, some strategists have called for a longer period of higher inflation and higher interest rates, an end to the so-called “Great Moderation.”  BlackRock predicts that fixed income ETF assets under management will reach $5 trillion by 2030. As Ramji said, “Having rates as low as they were for as long as they were was kind of the aberration. I think we’re resetting back now to a much more normal fixed income environment, and the great thing for investors, as a result, is they can use it to generate income, and so for retirees or people looking at their wealth portfolios, they’re able to generate good, long-term income from long-term investments like Treasuries or investment grade.” In other words, for a lot of retail investors right now, boring is beautiful. - Economy Wholesale Inventories, January Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before Senate Banking Committee Earnings Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS); Casey's General (CASY); CrowdStrike (CRWD); Manchester United (MANU); Sea Limited (SE); Stitch Fix (SFIX); Thor Industries (THO) Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"
2023-03-06,tsla,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-march-6-2023-123642397.html,"U.S. stocks lost steam Monday afternoon after rallying earlier in the session, kicking off a busy week on Wall Street with a mixed tone. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended the session near the flatline, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) increased 0.1%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) edged down 0.1%, reversing its gains from earlier in the trading session. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note hovered near 4% Monday afternoon, before settling at 3.98%. Crude oil traded higher, with U.S. benchmark WTI up at $80.55 a barrel. The dollar index moved lower trading at $104.34. U.S. stocks gained on Friday to close out a volatile week, while bond yields pulled back from their recent highs. The three major indexes rose for the week, with the Dow Jones adding 1.7%, the S&P 500 closing 1.9% higher, and the Nasdaq gaining 2.6%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury settled back below the key 4% level, and the two-year yield fell to 4.86%. Economic data released on Friday showed the services sector grew in February. This week, Wall Street will be paying close attention to the monthly jobs report out Friday. The February jobs report is expected to show 215,000 new jobs have been added to the economy, according to economist estimates, a slower pace from January’s blowout number of 517,000 job additions. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.4%. Another key point from the report will be wage growth, with a 0.3% month-to-month bump in average hourly earnings anticipated and 4.7% over the last year. Economists at Bank of America, led by Michael Gapen, believe a deceleration from January will be tied largely to weather shifts and a general mean-reverting nature of payrolls. ""Typically, when payroll growth records a sizable increase or decrease, we see a reversal in the following month,"" the firm noted. Also, investors will be keeping an eye on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's two-day biannual monetary policy testimony on Capitol Hill, which begins Tuesday. Other highlights this week include ADP’s monthly read on private payroll growth, January’s report on job openings from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Fed’s Beige Book. In single stock moves, Apple (AAPL) shares gained nearly 2% on Monday as Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng initiated coverage of Apple with a buy rating and a price target of $199. Ng noted Apple's success in hardware design and brand loyalty has led to a growing installed base of users that provide visibility into revenue growth. And Apple's valuation is attractive relative to its historical multiple and to peers. Ciena (CIEN) shares jumped 4% Monday after the company posted better than expected results that topped analysts expectations amid strong demand in its networking platforms business. Shares of BridgeBio Pharma (BBIO) surged more than 50% after the company topped Wall Street's expectations in a study of children with achondroplasia, a genetic condition that slows bone growth. Snap (SNAP) shares climbed 9% amid growing chatter that the U.S. could restrict — or ban — use of the TikTok app. Spirit Airlines (SAVE) shares tanked nearly 9% following reports that JetBlue Airways (JBLU) is bracing for turbulence from the Justice Department as it tries to block the airline's planned takeover of Spirit Airlines in the coming days, The Wall Street Journal reported. JetBlue shares finished up about 1%. On the earnings front, Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Oracle (ORCL) and BJ's Wholesale (BJ) are set to report results this week. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-06,tsla,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/as-airbnb-wins-back-wall-street-some-hosts-see-saturation-130755035.html,"Airbnb (ABNB) dazzled Wall Street with better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings results and forward guidance on February 14. ""We believe ADR [average daily rate] was the key upside surprise relative to investor expectations,"" Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni wrote about the company's Q1 guidance in a research note, ""which should help support more optimism around further upside on pricing and margin in the remaining three quarters [of 2023]."" Investors cheered the company's quarter by sending shares up 13% on February 15, the stock's biggest one-day increase since Airbnb's December 2020 IPO. On February 16, the stock logged its highest close since May 2022. Even after giving back some post-earnings gains, Airbnb stock is up about 45% from a record low reached at the end of 2022. But the sentiment shift came as something of a surprise to hosts and managers using the home-booking platform who say they are finding it harder and harder to book guests. Ric Kenworthy, who manages 96 short-rental property listings through a company, Old Town Rental, in Arizona, was scrambling to fill unbooked units ahead of last month's Super Bowl in Glendale. ""We ended up at, let's just assume midday Saturday before the Super Bowl, close to 90% booked for all of our properties,"" Kenworthy told Yahoo Finance, later adding: ""Some key markets are experiencing quite a bit of saturation."" Kenworthy said he ended up cutting his listing prices by 50%: The going-rate for one of his rental properties went for $450-$600 a night that weekend after he'd been anticipating a rate closer to $1,000 a night given the demand generally created by an event like the Super Bowl. ""In 2022, we saw new heights in demand on the Airbnb platform and the result is continued growth in typical Host income, which was over $14,000 in the US,"" Sam Randall, a representative for Airbnb, told Yahoo Finance in a statement. ""We continue to invest in the success of our Host community and in the coming months will release new pricing tools to help them set competitive prices."" While some Airbnb hosts may not be feeling the full benefits, there is little doubt travel demand is back in full swing. Despite sticky inflation, consumers are booking trips: Data from a Bank of America Institute survey shows money spent on airline travel per household jumped 3.5% in January while international spending also increased compared to two years ago. ""I think the psychological impact of being locked down for some portion of the pandemic has only accelerated the trend that had already started,"" Marriott International (MAR) CEO Anthony Capuano told Yahoo Finance Live after the company's fourth-quarter earnings results showed the average room rates up 13% and revenue earned per average room jumping 29% year over year. Airbnb posted revenue of $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter, better than analyst expectations for revenues of $1.86 billion. The company's earnings per share also topped estimates, coming in at $0.48 cents against $0.08 forecasted. On the company's earnings call, CEO Brian Chesky told analysts Airbnb experienced ""tremendous growth"" in units listed online, ending 2022 with 6.6 million active listings. That was 16% higher compared to the previous year. Chesky attributed the increase in supply to two factors: demand and systematic improvements to their platform. As people flocked back to traveling, nights and experiences booked increased 20% in the fourth quarter, with active bookers in the fourth quarter reaching a record for the company. ""[Annual] revenue of $8.4 billion grew 40% year-over-year,"" Chesky said on the earnings call. ""And when you exclude foreign exchange, our revenue increased by 46% year-over-year."" The average daily rate for an Airbnb accommodation grew 36% compared to 2019 levels, according to CFO David Stephenson. He noted that it's generally ""more expensive"" to stay at an Airbnb than other accommodations and projected rates would come down ""modestly"" through the end of this year. ""We're not seeing any major shifts in overall kind of utilization rate that give us any concern,"" Stephenson said. ""We feel like we continue to keep, in aggregate, this nice balance of growing supply and growing demand, and we want to keep that relative balance."" Airbnb also stressed that the company is focused on three strategic priorities: raising awareness of hosting, upgrading core services, and scaling services beyond its core offerings. In late 2022, Airbnb added short-term sublet listings in an effort to grow its footprint among the multifamily market. The company asserted landlords and property managers using the sublet service could earn about 20% of the booking revenue. Airbnb also rolled out new categories, including one called ""OMG,"" which captures the most unique and exclusive accommodations. And after a Wall Street Journal report highlighted how some travelers were frustrated with host-mandated chore lists and the app's pricing format leading to sneaky costs, Airbnb launched a feature to show users price totals that include cleaning, service, and other fees. Looking ahead, some wonder about the sustainability of Airbnb's boom. “Can the top line demand persist? And then given their growth and supply, can the average rates [hold]?,” Nick Jones, research analyst at JMP Securities, told Yahoo Finance. ""If the demand wanes, that's going to increase available supply at any given day, which then... should result in lower prices, which then would impact their profitability."" Even if demand plateaus, the situation could change: January data from AirDNA suggested that rapid listing growth ""outpaced rising demand"" in 2022. ""U.S. short-term rentals earned over $62 billion ($141 billion globally) throughout the year (up 25.1% YoY), with almost 200 million nights stayed and over two million listings receiving at least one booking,"" AirDNA stated. ""Overall occupancy ended the year at 58.7%, a significant drop from the 61.3% in 2021."" In any case, as travel evolves after the pandemic bust and boom, some Airbnb hosts see a shift in consumer behavior. Michelle Burson, owner of a 4,000 square-foot Airbnb in Brookings, Oregon, is experiencing less foot traffic for her rental unit. ""Our bookings [have] declined last year compared to the previous year,"" Burson said. In Burson's view, ""one of the reasons was people were taking their traditional vacations…going to Hawaii, Europe, rather than driving, [or taking] road trips."" And Masha Löfstedt, who owns three rental properties in Oregon, struggled to get her property booked ahead of the holiday season. ""One of our houses that rents out all the time, nobody's booked for this weekend. That's like the first time in years,"" Löfstedt told Yahoo Finance in late 2022.

While I really enjoyed watching Salesforce and C3.ai shares explode higher post earnings last week, hot movers along these lines have been too few and far between (in either direction) in recent weeks. But if you take a step back and level set the stock market today, the muted action kind of makes a great deal of sense. Investors are facing a fresh dilemma — call it paralysis by analysis amid all the incoming data flying in. On the one hand, we have hot retail sales and inflation reports from the government — both calling into question whether the Federal Reserve is moving fast enough to squash inflation. On the other end of the spectrum, the jobs market continues to be solid (as probably seen in this week's jobs report). Yet, when you look at fourth quarter earnings (and conference calls) from Best Buy, Home Depot, Target and other retailers, you will see consumer weakness in big ticket merchandise. Dig into Target's earnings, and you will see a shopper trading down to cheaper private label goods because they are less inflationary and they just got laid off by a tech company. Taken together, this is a confusing time to be an investor – something market maven Keith Lerner at Truist captures in a new note he sent me: ""The recent action is very much aligned with a key market dilemma we have been highlighting: If the economy stays stronger, as we have seen recently, Fed policy is set to remain tighter, and this will weigh on market valuations. Or, instead, if the economy weakens, this will pressure profits. Neither of these outcomes are favorable for premium market valuations."" In other words, Mr. Market doesn't know what he wants! And if you think all the bad news of any kind is priced into stocks, Lerner adds these considerations: ""For perspective, the S&P 500’s forward P/E of 17.6x is still slightly above the 10-year average of 17.2x, and that’s in the context of a high degree of uncertainty around economic growth, inflation, and earnings. Forward earnings estimates are hovering near a 52- week low, and downside risks remain. The 1-year U.S. Treasury yield has jumped above 5% for the first time since 2007, and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which is hovering around 4%, is nearly double the average of the past decade.""

2023-03-04,tsla,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/bankman-fried-flip-phone-limited-153437236.html,"By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sam Bankman-Fried should be allowed while on bail to have a flip phone with no internet capability and a basic laptop with limited functions, but be forbidden from using other electronic communication devices, the U.S. Department of Justice said. The proposal to limit the indicted FTX cryptocurrency exchange founder's communications was filed late on Friday in Manhattan federal court, on behalf of the government and Bankman-Fried's defense team. It requires approval by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who oversees the case. Kaplan had signaled at a Feb. 16 hearing that he might jail the 30-year-old Bankman-Fried for testing the limits of his $250 million bail package by communicating in ways that could not be monitored. The judge said he did not want to set Bankman-Fried ""loose in this garden of electronic devices,"" following accusations that Bankman-Fried tried to contact possible government witnesses and used a virtual private network to watch football. Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty after prosecutors said he stole billions of dollars of FTX customer funds to plug losses at his Alameda Research hedge fund. He faces 12 criminal charges under an indictment made public on Feb. 23. The proposed flip phone or other non-smartphone for Bankman-Fried would be limited to voice calls and SMS text messages. Laptop internet use would be restricted to specified virtual private networks, 23 websites for personal use including news, sports and food delivery, and websites to help Bankman-Fried prepare for his scheduled Oct. 2 trial. Bankman-Fried is living under house arrest with his parents, both Stanford Law School professors, in Palo Alto, California. The parents agreed to submit sworn affidavits that they would not bring other electronic devices into their home or let their son use theirs. They also agreed that each device would carry software that periodically takes videos or photos of the user, which court officers would be allowed to review, the letter said. Bankman-Fried's lawyers did not immediately respond on Saturday to requests for comment. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York and Anirudh Saligrama in Bengaluru; Editing by Daniel Wallis)"

At the close, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) surged 1.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) increased 1.1%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 2%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note (^TNX) moved back and forth around the key 4% level Friday, eventually settling below the line, after services data showed economic activity expanded in February. Crude oil traded higher, with U.S. benchmark WTI (CL=F) up at $79.71 a barrel. On the economic data side, economic activity in the services sector grew in February for the second consecutive month as the ISM Services PMI came in at 55.1, slightly lower from 55.2 recorded in January and above economist expectations of 54.5. February's ISM Services figures ""suggests activity continues to expand at a reasonably healthy pace, but provides further reason to doubt the idea that there has been a resurgence in growth since the start of the year,"" Andrew Hunter, deputy chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note following the release. The moves come after the Federal Reserve published a semiannual Monetary Policy Report to Congress that details the central bank's plans to hike interest rates as a means to restore price stability. Officials indicated ""that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2% over time,"" the Fed said in its report. Stocks rallied on Thursday, with the S&P 500 trading lower for most of the session before rallying after commentary from Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic. Bostic said he’s still open to raising rates by another quarter percentage point at the central bank’s March meeting. “I let the data guide me,” Bostic told reporters in a press briefing. “If the data continue to come in suggesting the economy is stronger than I had projected, I’ll adjust my policy trajectory.” Bostic, who isn’t a voter on monetary policy this year, wrote an essay on Wednesday calling for the Fed to raise its policy rate by 50 basis points to a range of 5%-5.25% and then keep it there until well into 2024. Fed officials raised the benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point in February, pulling the target to stand in a range of 4.5%-4.75%. Policymakers will be releasing new projections after the central bank’s March 21-22 meeting. In single stock moves, C3.ai (AI) shares surged over 30% Friday after the company posted fiscal third quarter revenue that came at $66.7 million, beating analyst expectations of $64.2 million. Shares of Rivian (RIVN) jumped after the EV maker said on Friday it's keeping to the original production forecast of 50,000 vehicles in 2023. Costco (COST) shares sank 2% after the bulk retailer posted mixed results for the second quarter. Total revenue for its latest quarter was $55.27 billion, slightly below analysts' expectations of $55.58 billion. During the earnings call, the company provided some hopeful news on the inflation front. ChargePoint (CHPT) shares were down Friday after the maker of EV charging stations reported disappointing results and issued softer guidance. Shares of Amazon (AMZN) were up 3% as the company pauses construction on its second quarters in Arlington, Virginia. The move follows the tech giant's announcements of job cuts in the wake of slowing consumer and corporate spending. Marvell Technology (MRVL) stock fell after the company reported mixed results, with earnings in line with expectations but guidance weaker than forecasted. Shares of Meta Platforms (META) surged 6% as the company announced it would slash prices of its Quest Pro virtual-reality headset after the product launch. In the cryptocurrency market, both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) fell as customers pull their funds from crypto bank Silvergate (SI), whose stock plunged more than 57% during the trading session on Thursday. Following the drop in Bitcoin, the pullback is close to 10% and the digital asset was on pace to close below its 50-day moving average for the first time in almost two months, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-02,tsla,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-today-march-2-2023-135533324.html,"Stocks rallied on Thursday with the Dow leading markets higher as results from Salesforce (CRM) lifted the index, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq shook off early losses to finish in the green. At the close on Thursday, the S&P 500 was up 0.76%, the Nasdaq higher by 0.73%, and the blue chip Dow up 1.05%. Rates remained a key focus for investors, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note settling north of 4%, its highest level since November. The rise in yields has come as investors brace for more aggressive action from the Federal Reserve in the coming months as inflation stays elevated and the economy remains strong. On the front end of the Treasury curve, the yield on 2-year notes continued to trade near its highest level since 2007. The 2-year yield, which stood near 4.8% on Thursday, is seen as the best proxy for investor expectations of the Fed's near-term path for interest rates. In single-stock moves, shares of Salesforce rose 11.5% on Thursday as investors cheered the company's latest quarterly report, which saw the embattled Dow member double down on cost-cutting initiatives and shareholder return plans. The stock's opening gap higher of 16% was its largest since Aug. 2020, according to data from Bloomberg. In an interview with Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi late Wednesday, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in reference to the company's efficiency initiatives: ""We have hit the hyper-space button."" The company announced in its quarterly report an increase in its share repurchase authorization to $20 billion, with COO Brian Millham telling investors on a call, ""We're inspecting every part of our business to find opportunities to drive efficiencies and reduce cost of sales, marketing, and G&A."" Salesforce's 11.5% jump, good for jsut over a $19 per share increase in the stock price, added roughly 110 points to the price-weighted Dow's 340 point gain on Thursday. Elsewhere in single-stock moves, shares of troubled bank Silvergate (SI) fell 57% on Thursday after the company delayed the filing of its annual report and said it would likely report losses larger than those previously disclosed. The bank took on several high-profile crypto clients in recent years and has seen its share price collapse by more than 90% in the wake of the failure of FTX, among other crypto bankruptcies. Tesla (TSLA) shares were also in focus on Thursday, falling 5.9% as the electric carmaker held its latest investor day on Wednesday, which revealed few new product details but emphasized the company's push to unlock new efficiencies in its manufacturing and design processes. On the economic data side, the weekly report on initial jobless claims showed 190,000 new filings for unemployment insurance were made last week, the latest sign the labor market remains robust. Though tomorrow marks the first Friday of the month, the February jobs report will not be released until March 10.

2023-03-02,tsla,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/mortgage-rates-surge-closer-to-7-170022384.html,"Mortgage rates jumped higher this week, getting even closer to 7% and crushing homebuyer activity, which hit a 28-year low. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage increased to 6.65% from 6.50% the week prior, according to Freddie Mac. Rates have climbed over a half-point in February, reversing declines since mid-November. The spike in rates is another blow to would-be buyers, who are also facing still-high home prices and a shortage of affordable homes for sale. Sellers also appear to be pulling their listings, rather than cutting prices further to spur interest. “I think the biggest concern is buying into a market that would continue to go down,” Jeff Reynolds, broker at Compass and founder of UrbanCondoSpaces, recently told Yahoo Finance. “In my 18-year career, I have never seen rate moves like we are seeing now.” The volume of applications to purchase a home slid by 6% from one week earlier, the Mortgage Bankers Association’s survey of applications for the week ending Feb. 24 found. Overall, demand was 44% lower than the same week a year ago and has nosedived to a 28-year low. The drop in demand registered this past month is a sign that affordability remains a top concern, according to Redfin Deputy Chief Economist Taylor Marr. “The housing market took two steps forward in December and January, but has taken one step back in February,” Marr said in a statement. “Mortgage rates crept back this month, which is prompting more buyers and sellers to back off.” Another reason for the pullback in demand is rising home prices. The national median list price increased to $415,000 in February, Realtor.com data showed, up from $406,000 in January. While that’s down 7.6% from June’s peak of $449,000 – it still represents a yearly growth rate of 7.8%. That translates to out-of-pocket costs for buyers. According to Realtor.com, the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home is roughly $630 higher than a year ago. That puts the monthly mortgage payment 45.1% higher than a year ago, exceeding rent growth, up 2.9% from a year ago, and inflation, up 6.4%. As rates continue to climb, fewer home sellers are active this year. The number of newly-listed homes for sale declined by 15.9% in February compared with the previous year, Realtor.com data found. That’s a larger rate of decline versus January’s 10.4% decrease, but a small improvement from November and December. Overall, new listings remained 27% below pre-pandemic 2017 to 2019 levels. According to Redfin, existing homeowners don’t want to move because they don’t want to give up their ultra-low mortgage rates. As of February, approximately 85% of mortgage holders have a rate far below 6%. Homeowners may also be hesitant to put their homes on the market due to soft homebuyer demand that’s forcing sellers to cut prices. “We'll find out in the next 30 days if buyers are getting used to higher rates,” Reynolds said, “or if they will stay on the sideline waiting for rates to come back to earth.” Gabriella is a personal finance reporter at Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-02,tsla,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/what-the-end-of-the-great-moderation-era-means-for-investors-morning-brief-103057491.html,"This article first appeared in the Morning Brief. Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET. Subscribe Thursday, March 2, 2023 Today's newsletter is by Jared Blikre, a reporter focused on the markets on Yahoo Finance. Follow him on Twitter @SPYJared. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. In 2004, then-Fed chair Ben Bernanke gave a speech titled, ""The Great Moderation."" His thesis: ""One of the most striking features of the economic landscape over the past twenty years or so has been a substantial decline in macroeconomic volatility."" And while the Global Financial Crisis dented this belief, a post-crisis economic recovery and stock market boom brought these ideas back into vogue among many investors who rode a ""stocks only go up"" rally for more than a decade. But with inflation at multi-decade highs and interest rates at their highest levels in over 15 years, some investors are saying that the old investing epoch has come to an end — ushering in a new era where fundamentals matter, traditional savers are rewarded once again, and the volatility that Bernanke said goodbye to is back. In other words, choppier waters might be the new norm for a while. There are a few things that are starkly different about this present business cycle, Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, told Yahoo Finance Live Wednesday. First, there's the hot labor market, despite the white-collar layoffs. Historically, it's the lower-wage workers that are first in line to get cut. ""Yet another thing about this cycle that is just so different relative to past cycles,"" Saunders said. To date, this downturn has been felt mostly at the upper ends of the wealth spectrum, with asset prices like stocks, bonds, and real estate suffering declines. Meanwhile, inflation is a pernicious problem that disproportionately affects lower incomes. But it has not yet become entrenched — at least in the eyes of policy makers. Investors may not know what to think, but Sonders expects the current fog to lift a bit when we get the next batch of quarterly reports in April. But it might not be a clarity worth celebrating. Analysts have already been lowering the bar for the first quarter earnings, and Sonders believes they have a ways to go considering the bond market is signaling the Fed needs to be yet more aggressive. ""One of the factors most highly correlated to corporate earnings is the 10-year [U.S. Treasury] yield, with a lag,"" she says. Sonders believes the 10-year yield is forecasting the Fed will need to keep rates higher for longer, and that ""the path of least resistance for [earnings estimates] is down"" — targeting the first half of this year. Whether or not that near-term pain materializes, Sonders closes the door on the prior epoch of declining rates and volatility, then describes what investors can expect in the years to come. ""I think that the end of the Great Moderation era is very much here ... Gone are the days of cheap access to goods, cheap access to energy, [and] cheap access to labor. I think all three of those ships have sailed,"" she says. Sonders argues that reversing the engine of globalization and reorienting toward regionalism will have profound investing implications over the secular time frame. ""I would therefore expect greater inflation volatility, economic volatility, [and] geopolitical volatility. We're in this era of regionalization and demographic shifts that are pretty painful."" But as painful as these changes are for workers, consumers and investors alike, there are opportunities for investors. Consider that the Fed has finally raised short-term rates — the so-called risk-free rate — to levels that prevailed in decades prior. ""With the return of the risk-free [Treasury] rate, it's brought secular changes, including the fact that fundamentals are reattaching to prices,"" says Sonders. She goes on to explain that the market is no longer skewed so heavily toward mega cap stocks, and that there's hope for stock pickers once again after over a decade of underperformance. ""This has important implications and helps explain why equal-weighted [stock indices] have generally been doing better than [market] cap-weighted [indices] — why active [investing] has been doing better than passive [investing] — or at least is on a more level playing field with passive. And I think those are secular and as important backdrops for investors to think about.""

2023-03-02,tsla,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/silvergate-stock-crashes-after-company-delays-annual-report-reveals-new-losses-121923800.html,"Shares of troubled lender Silvergate (SI) fell 57% on Thursday after the company said late Wednesday it will miss a March 16 deadline to file its already-delayed annual report. The bank said its team ""requires additional time to perform analysis, record journal entries related to subsequent events and to complete management’s evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting."" ""The Company is currently analyzing certain regulatory and other inquiries and investigations that are pending with respect to the Company,"" the company added. Silvergate shares have collapsed over the last year as the company's entanglements with several crypto firms — including bankrupt exchange FTX, among others — resulted in deposits falling by more than two-thirds in the fourth quarter of last year. In January, the company laid off 40% of its staff. The company later suspended a dividend paid on preferred shares as it sought to shore up cash. Over the last year, shares of the bank have lost more than 95%. A spokesperson for Silvergate told Yahoo Finance: ""Silvergate is working diligently to file its 10-K as soon as possible and has no further comment at this time."" In Wednesday's notice, the bank said it sold additional debt securities beyond what was previously anticipated in January and February and it expects to record further losses than what was previously disclosed. In January, the company disclosed it took $887 million worth of non-interest losses in the fourth quarter. The sales are primarily to repay ""outstanding advances"" it received from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, Silvergate said. The bank also needs additional time to complete an ""evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting"" being conducted by its third party accounting firm. Citing business and regulatory challenges, the company is weighing how much the changes might affect its ""ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements,"" according to the filing. In late January, a bi-partisan group of U.S. Senators pressed the company to provide answers over whether it was aware its clients FTX misused customer funds. A Reuters report in February said a Silvergate account controlled by Binance.US moved millions of dollars to a company controlled by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. Last week in a joint statement with the Federal Deposit and Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve made a point to highlight the heightened liquidity risks for banks taking on crypto-related clients. As for its own risks, Silvergate cited “heightened regulatory scrutiny of banking institutions that provide products and services to the digital asset industry,"" private litigation, and investigations from congressional inquiries, banking regulators and the Justice Department. Analysts at JPMorgan downgraded the stock to Underweight from Neutral and withdrew their its price target in a note out Thursday, calling the situation ""highly unusual"" and adding: ""The 'run' experienced at Silvergate appears to have been driven by a combination of (1) trust in the overall system being shaken given the collapse of previously trusted players (such as FTX) and (2) short-sellers voicing concerns (primarily on Twitter).""

2023-03-01,tsla,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-march-1-2023-124448484.html,"U.S. stocks finished mostly lower Wednesday to start March as key manufacturing data offered mixed results and two Federal Reserve officials suggested a more aggressive rate-hiking campaign in the coming months. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) declined by 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was flat. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell by 0.6%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note moved upward and briefly touched 4% Wednesday. Crude oil traded higher, with U.S. benchmark WTI up at $77.73 a barrel. On the economic data side, U.S. manufacturing firms signaled a grim outlook for the sector, according to the latest PMI data from S&P Global. The seasonally adjusted S&P Global US Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index was revised lower to 47.3 in February, up from 46.9 in January. The reading indicates ""a solid deterioration in the health of the goods-producing sector, despite the pace of decline softening to the slowest for three months."" Separately, economic activity in the manufacturing sector diminished in February for the fourth consecutive month following a 28-month period of growth, according to the Institute for Supply Management report on business. The data offered a mixed bag. Employment in manufacturing decreased to 49.10 in February from 50.60 in January. New orders rose to 47.0 compared to January's figure of 42.5. Prices paid jumped to 51.3 from January's reading of 44.5. Stocks fell Tuesday, rounding out the last day of a volatile month of February on Wall Street. According to JP Morgan’s trading desk, February’s month-end rebalance drove some weakness in equities and strength in bonds Tuesday afternoon. With February in the rearview, the S&P 500 remains up more than 3% this year, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group. Mega-caps have been a massive driver of the index moves. That said, 20 of the largest stocks in the S&P 500 have accounted for most of the index’s gains. Now, as the calendar turns, March historically sees the S&P 500’s gains in the second half of the month, Bespoke Investment Group noted. The path of the Federal Reserve's rate hikes remains in focus for investors. Two Federal Reserve officials spoke on Wednesday leaned in the move that aggressive interest rate hikes are the path forward to ease inflation. They followed Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, who said on Tuesday it would be a “danger and a mistake for policy makers to rely too heavily on market reactions” and emphasized the importance to “supplement these traditional data with observations on the ground from the real economy.” However, Goolsbee, who will be a voter at this year’s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting, didn’t comment on monetary policy. Since last year, the Fed has sharply raised rates in an effort to cool inflation. But inflation remains sticky. Policymakers will be releasing new projections after the central bank’s March 21-22 meeting. On the housing front, mortgage rates continue to move upward, pushing buyers to the sidelines as the spring housing market is underway. Both purchase and refinance applications slumped last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index. Volume of purchase applications hit a 28-year low, down 44% from a year ago. Here are some of the tickers trending on Yahoo Finance today:  Eli Lilly and Company (LLY): The drugmaker announced Wednesday morning it expects to cap out-of-pocket cost of its insulin at $35 a month. The plan comes as a promise to provide critical relief to some people with diabetes, who at times face higher medical costs. Kohl's (KSS): Shares of the retail giant declined nearly 2% Wednesday after the company posted a surprise fourth-quarter loss and sales slumped as consumer habits shift away from discretionary spending. Wendy's (WEN): The fast-food chain announced in its quarterly earnings about its plans to target sales growth through 2025 as it streamlines costs. Rivian (RIVN): The electric truck manufacturer’s guidance for fiscal 2023 deliveries came in 20% below estimates as the EV maker struggles to scale up its truck, van, and SUV production. Nio (NIO): Another EV maker gave weak revenue guidance. The Chinese premium EV startup, reported a much worse-than-expected fourth-quarter loss as margins took a hit due to in part to ""losses on purchase commitments."" Novavax (NVAX): The vaccine maker warned of its ability to stay in business through next year. This comes as the company has struggled to develop and enter the COVID-19 vaccine market. Alibaba (BABA): The stock climbed in the wake of the group’s quarterly earnings, and fueled by the 4% surge in the Hang Seng index overnight. Dollar Tree (DLTR): The discount retailer stock rose nearly 2% after the company posted weaker guidance for the current fiscal year. Tesla (TSLA): The EV maker is set to kickoff its first Investor Day event on Wednesday from its gigafactory in Austin, Texas. CEO Elon Musk is expected to announce new Tesla products that aim to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and lead to a ""fully sustainable energy future."" HP (HPQ): The PC and printing giant's stock wavered after the company posted mix results amid a soft demand environment for personal computers. Fiscal-quarter sales dropped 18% year-over-year. Printer sales sank 5% from a year ago. Reata Pharmaceuticals (RETA): The stock surged nearly 200% Wednesday after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved the company's treatment for Friedreich’s ataxia, a rare inherited disease that causes damage to the nervous system. Lowe's (LOW): The home-improvement company reported weaker fiscal sales in the fourth quarter and issued a conservative outlook ahead, with comparable sales expected to be flat to down 2% compared to the prior year.

2023-03-01,tsla,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/goldman-sachs-tries-to-reset-firm-culture-after-three-unusual-years-171038235.html,"Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon addressed negative headlines surrounding the bank's culture during the company's second-ever investor day on Tuesday. ""I hate the noise,"" Solomon said bluntly. ""I live in the same neighborhood as you all live in and I wish the noise was different."" Various media reports of mass partner exits, coupled with recent Wall Street chatter the bank has lost its way after the failure of its consumer banking project Marcus, have all contributed to unfavorable sentiment. And this coming after the company laid off some 3,200 workers positions, or a little over 6% of its headcount, in January after a challenging 2022. Solomon admitted mistakes were made, telling investors: ""I think we’ve accomplished a lot over the past few years. We got some things right, got some things wrong."" ""I read things in the paper that don’t match what’s happening inside the firm,"" Solomon continued, explaining there were fewer partner transitions in 2022 than any other year going back to 2014. ""The culture of Goldman Sachs is incredibly strong. ...We have an extraordinary group of people working incredibly hard,"" he said. ""We also recognize we've gone through a very unusual period over last 3 years — the pandemic was a very tough thing on a culture like ours."" Goldman Sachs shares, down about 5% over the past month, are trading relatively flat year-to-date — underperforming the S&P 500's 3% gain over that same time period. Solomon went on to note Goldman is a ""human business,"" explaining the firm has made conscious decisions to invest in its culture with leadership spending more time with partners throughout the year to help push a greater sense of community throughout the organization. ""We’re going to continue to invest in our culture. I think it's very good, [but] I do think we've had dramatic shifts,"" he said, once again referencing the pandemic which was quickly followed by an unfavorable macro environment. ""That created more noise, more grumbling than usual."" Overall, ""I feel good about the partnerships [and] the culture, but that doesn't mean we don't have to keep investing,"" he reiterated. Goldman saw a rough end to 2022 with profits down a whopping 69% in Q4 amid a serious decline in deal-making revenues, pressured by a weakening economic backdrop. Following Tuesday's presentation, analyst reaction appeared cautiously optimistic, although questions remain over the path to profitability for its consumer banking unit, otherwise known as platform solutions. Shares of Goldman fell about 4% on Tuesday as the company made its pitch to investors. ""Coming out of the conference, the buzz among investors was whether GS will grow the consumer businesses or sell parts of them. Our interpretation of management's commentary is that both options are on the table,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck wrote in a new note published on Wednesday. Graseck maintained her Equal Weight rating and reiterated a 12-month price target of $332 a share. Graseck added all three business segments, which also includes investment banking and trading along with wealth and asset management, ""have an opportunity to contribute to Y/Y EPS growth as GS targets growth opportunities and gets more efficient."" Goldman reported a net loss of $660 million in its platform solutions unit in the fourth quarter with a full-year net loss settling at $1.67 billion. The company blamed the decline on higher provisions for credit losses, but stressed on Tuesday: ""Profitability is not a strategy. It is a priority and the outcome of a strategy well executed."" Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala told clients Wednesday Goldman's profitability push seemed genuine, writing: ""While investors looking for instant gratification may have been disappointed, we believe that management is on the same page with shareholders in that it appreciates the need to further shrink its consumer exposure ""unlock value"" (specifically, card partnerships and point-of-sale lending)."" Poonawala maintained a Buy rating and reiterated a $384 price target on the stock. Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-01,tsla,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/feds-bostic-kashkari-call-for-higher-rates-after-concerning-inflation-jobs-data-150224928.html,"Two Federal Reserve officials speaking Wednesday said more aggressive interest rate hikes are likely necessary to slow inflation, as is the central bank keeping rates at elevated levels for some time. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said Wednesday he is remaining ""open-minded"" about whether the Fed should raise rates by 25 or 50 basis points at its next policy meeting on March 21-22. Markets currently expect a 25 basis point, or 0.25%, rate increase from the central bank. ""I’m open-minded about whether it's 25 or 50 basis points [at the next meeting],"" Kashkari said during a Q&A at a Sioux Falls Business CEO event. ""What's more important is what we signal in the dot plot."" The Fed will release a new set of economic forecasts and interest rate expectations alongside its March 22 policy statement. Kashkari said in December, he jotted down raising interest rates up to 5.4% and holding rates at that level for an extended period. ""At this point I haven't decided what my dot is, but I would lean towards continuing to raise further that I would continue to push up my policy path."" ""Given the data in the last month — higher inflation than we expected and a strong jobs report — these are concerning data points suggesting we're not making progress as quickly as we'd like,"" Kashkari said. ""At the same time shouldn't overreact to one month of data even if the data is troubling."" Kashkari is a voting member of the FOMC, the Fed committee that sets monetary policy, in 2023. Elsewhere, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said Wednesday he believes the Fed needs to raise its policy rate by 50 basis points, to a range of 5%-5.25%, and hold it at that level until well into 2024. ""We must determine when inflation is irrevocably moving lower,"" Bostic wrote in an essay published Wednesday. ""We're not there yet. That's why I think we need to raise the federal funds rate to between 5-5.25% and leave it there well into 2024. This will allow tighter policy to filter through the economy and ultimately bring aggregate supply and aggregate demand into better balance and thus lower inflation."" Bostic is not a voting member of the FOMC in 2023, but will be a voting member in 2024. Bostic said in order to consider reversing the course of monetary policy, he needs to see a better balance in the job market between labor supply and demand and see broad-based inflation narrow. Bostic noted about half of the goods in the CPI market basket still show inflation rates of 6% or higher. The Fed targets inflation that averages 2%. ""If we are going to get inflation back in the range of our target, the breadth of inflation will have to narrow considerably,"" Bostic wrote. ""When inflation is no longer top of mind, our mission will largely be accomplished. We are clearly not there yet. But I—and the Committee—are committed to doing all we can to ensure that we get there as soon as possible."" Both Bostic and Kashkari noted that while the increase in interest rates has slowed the housing and real estate sectors, they aren’t seeing many signs higher rates are really slowing down the rest of the economy. ""Business contacts tell us activity may well soften, but they don't anticipate a severe deterioration,"" Bostic wrote. ""When businesses think customers will buy less of their product or service in the near and medium term, then they will adjust hiring and investment plans accordingly."" Kashkari said the U.S is not in recession right now pointing to strong job growth, but said whether the Fed can avoid causing a recession with its interest rate hikes to fight inflation — a so-called soft-landing —remains an open question. ""The track record is not good at being able to slow down the economy this much without going a little too far and heading into recession,"" he said. ""[But] typically, when the central bank has caused a recession by raising interest rates, the bounce back can be very fast."" Kashkari said the dynamics in this economic cycle are different given families and states have strong balance sheets and supply chains are getting better. Both Fed officials said the cost of raising rates too much outweighs the costs of raising rates too little, adding the Fed must avoid a 1970s scenario in which the central bank cut rates too soon, causing inflation to re-surge and forcing the Volcker-led Fed to hike rates much higher to ultimately bring down inflation.

2023-03-01,tsla,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/consumers-keep-feeling-better-about-today-and-worse-about-tomorrow-morning-brief-103054340.html,"This article first appeared in the Morning Brief.

Follow him on Twitter @MylesUdland and on LinkedIn. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. U.S. consumers and the executives that Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon talks to have a lot in common — they feel good about today and worse about tomorrow. New data out from The Conference Board on Tuesday showed consumer confidence dipped in February, with the decline entirely driven by expectations. The Conference Board's index fell to 102.9 in February from 106 in January and 109 in December; December's reading was the highest since Sept. 2021. Underneath the surface of this decline, however, was another month where a strong labor market lifted consumers' current expectations while fears about the future loomed. ""The present situation index rose for a third straight month, underpinned by upbeat views on employment and business conditions,"" wrote Gurleen Chadha, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, in a note to clients on Tuesday. ""That index rose 1.7pts to 152.8. The differential between jobs 'plentiful' and jobs 'hard to get' rose to 41.5ppts, the highest since April 2022, indicating that current labor market conditions are still quite tight."" In January, the U.S. economy added a surprising 517,000 jobs while the unemployment rate stood at 3.4%. Meanwhile, speaking at Goldman's second-ever investor day on Tuesday, Solomon said the executives he spends his days speaking with are feeling better about a ""soft landing"" for the economy, but that inflation worries are ""hampering confidence."" ""When I talk to CEOs, they feel more uncertain about the course of inflation as we run through 2023, 2024. ...There's a real belief that inflation will be stickier and harder to moderate than markets now predict,"" Solomon said. The Conference Board's data shows consumers remain pleasantly surprised the soft labor market they'd braced for hasn't materialized just as executives fretting over recession remain similarly relieved. And yet both groups in their own way remain braced for some version of economic impact. It's just not clear that hasn't already happened. We're coming off a year in which the S&P 500 fell 19%, the price of gas in the U.S. hit $5 a gallon, and the inflation rate reached 9.1%. In less than a year, the Fed has raised interest rates 4.5%. The housing market got crushed. And the most popular investing strategy for those saving for retirement endured its worst year on record. All things that have improved in 2023. And if there's one theme that been pervasive in markets and the economy for some time now it's a sense from investors and consumers that the worst is yet to come. Economists at Wells Fargo said in a note consumer confidence data ""pours some cold water on the streak of strong economic data received to start the year."" Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, said Tuesday, ""if consumers drive the economy, the outlook for 2023 is bleak as the consumers expect that the worst is yet to come."" On Tuesday, The Conference Board's Expectations Index stood at 69.7, notable as any reading below 80 is typically consistent with recession, according to the report. This index, however, has been below 80 for 11 of the last 12 months. And we wait for the recession still.

2023-02-28,tsla,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-february-28-2023-120603661.html,"U.S. stocks fell Tuesday, rounding out the last day of a volatile month of February on Wall Street. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) edged lower by 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined 0.7%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ticked down by 0.1%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked up to 3.92% Tuesday afternoon. The U.S. benchmark WTI crude oil moved higher to trade around $76.94 a barrel. The dollar index was up, trading at $104.92. Stocks closed higher on Monday, fueling a temporary rebound from Wall Street's worst week of the year. All three indexes ended February in the red after an optimistic start to the year in January. Economic data released on Tuesday showed that retail inventories, excluding auto, rose 0.3%, higher than 0.1% expected by economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Meanwhile, wholesale inventories declined 0.4%, below consensus estimates of 0.1%. American consumers felt worse about the economy in February, the Confidence Board reported. The board's Consumer Confidence Index slumped to 102.9 from 106.0, below consensus estimates of 108.5,  Meanwhile, February Chicago PMI dipped to 43.6 from 44.3, also below consensus expectations. “Consumers and businesses are looking for ways to reduce expenses in anticipation of much weaker activity over the rest of the year. The drop in consumer confidence in February aligns with weaker business confidence readings as the Fed’s sharp increase in interest rates start to bite,"" Ben Ayers, Nationwide senior economist, wrote in a statement. Other data showed that home prices fell 0.5% in December, according to data from S&P Corelogic Case-Shiller Index. On a yearly basis, home prices rose 4.6%, lower than analysts' expectations of 4.8%. As inflation still remains sticky, Federal Reserve Governor Philip Jefferson on Monday shot down arguments for raising the central bank’s 2% inflation target and said he is under ""no illusion"" that it's going to be easy to get the inflation rate back down. This week, investors will remain focused on the retail sector. On Tuesday, earnings from Target (TGT) topped analysts' expectations as consumer spending continues to move away from discretionary categories. The retailer’s same-store sales grew by 0.7%, above estimates of a 1.74% decline. The stock rose about 1% on Tuesday. Data from Bespoke Investment Group showed that over the last week, 420 stocks have reported earnings and the percentage of companies lowering guidance is more than double the percentage raising guidance, signaling ""lots of trouble for these smaller-cap companies that report late in the season."" In other single stock moves, Zoom (ZM) shares rose after the company posted better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings, with earnings per share of $1.22 higher than estimates of 80 cents. Revenue came in at $1.12 billion. Occidental Petroleum (OXY) shares moved down on Tuesday after the oil and gas producer posted fourth-quarter results that came in below Wall Street expectations on revenue and earnings per share. Shares of Workday (WDAY) were up after the human-resources software company topped expectations with revenue of $1.65 billion, up 20% year-over-year, against estimates of $1.63 billion. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (AMC) fell jumped on Tuesday after a Delaware court said it would hold a hearing on April 27, which will likely delay the date of conversion of convertible units APE to common stock. Tesla (TSLA) shares fell around 1% as Mexico's president confirmed that the EV maker will build a new plant in Monterrey, Mexico. The Mexican president said more details will be released at Tesla's investor day, and he said the plant is expected to be ""very big."" Shares of Coinbase (COIN) surged as fears of crypto regulation begin to fade. On Monday, the company was served a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission as the regulatory agency cracks down on cryptocurrency listings, its custody of digital assets and platform operations, and more, the company disclosed. Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) shares sank after the company reported a wider-than-expected loss and forecasted disappointing guidance for 2023 as the cruise operator gets squeezed by soaring fuel and labor costs. Separately, Bank of Nova Scotia shares dropped after the Canadian lender reported a missed in earnings estimates as a lull in its investment banking division dented income from its capital markets unit. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. Today the process opens for semiconductor companies to apply for a piece of the $39 billion grant money being allocated as part of the CHIPS and Science Act. But there's a catch: firms that win the funds may not be able to buy back stock – for a while, anyway. “We want to make sure that their money is being used to increase research and development in innovation and not to pad their bottom line or do buybacks,” said Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in an interview with Yahoo Finance. One could argue it’s the administration’s prerogative to decide how chipmakers that accept grants to build factories use that money. But the White House wants to go further, by boosting taxes on buybacks from their current 1%. In his State of the Union address earlier this month, President Joe Biden said that tax should be much higher: ""Corporations ought to do the right thing. That’s why I propose we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks and encourage long-term investments. They’ll still make considerable profit."" That proposal is what may have led Warren Buffett to weigh in on the hot-button issue in the Berkshire Hathaway CEO’s annual letter to investors: “When you are told that all repurchases are harmful to shareholders or to the country, or particularly beneficial to CEOs, you are listening to either an economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue (characters that are not mutually exclusive).” Even Buffett has a caveat, however: he says buybacks make sense only if they are made at “value-accretive prices,” i.e. when corporations don’t overpay. Taking a step back, corporations have a number of ways to spend their money, from building new plants to hiring people to research and development. They can also distribute the funds directly to shareholders by paying out dividends. Or they can repurchase shares, which has the effect of reducing overall share count, automatically increasing earnings per share. (In a simplified example, if a company makes $1 million in profit and has 50,000 shares outstanding, earnings per share are $20. If it buys back 10,000 of its shares, earnings per share go to $25, making an existing shareholder's stake more valuable.) And the numbers are a lot bigger than in the example above. Last year, U.S. companies announced a record $1.223 trillion of buybacks, according to data from EPFR TrimTabs. This year, it’s already running at $274.9 billion — heating up even after the 1% tax kicked in. Eliminating or restricting that tool, then, would be a big deal. Will it actually happen? In the case of companies accepting money as part of the CHIPS Act, it’s unclear whether they’ll be barred from doing buybacks at all, or just directly using the funding they’ve received. (Senator Elizabeth Warren and some of her colleagues in Congress want the participants to be barred from doing buybacks for 10 years). Secretary Raimondo said each case will be different, but the government will in theory have the ability to claw back money in the “most extreme cases” if companies do not comply with their agreements, whether that deals with buybacks or other stipulations. Investors in companies like Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) should take note, since they’re among the firms that have announced plans to build plants in the U.S. and are likely to apply for federal funding. As for whether a broader clampdown on buybacks is coming, policy analyst Ed Mills is skeptical. “Really, what this is about is setting up a strawman, as we get into debates about the debt ceiling,” Mills, a managing director at Raymond James, told Yahoo Finance in an interview. On the one hand, Republicans will fire up their rhetoric about getting the U.S. fiscal house in order. Democrats, led by President Biden, are likely to shoot back by saying Republicans aren’t willing to ask companies enacting big buybacks to pay more in taxes. “I don't think it happens, but I think it's going to be more part of the conversation than I think the market anticipates right now,” Mills said.

The Minneapolis-based retailer saw same-store sales increase by 0.7%, higher than Wall Street estimates of -1.74%. Similar to Walmart's (WMT) latest quarterly results, consumer spending at Target seemed to shift to essentials like food and away from categories like electronics, home, and apparel. Target shares jumped by more than 3.5% in pre-market trading after the report's release. Target CEO Brian Cornell said the team was pleased with the sales growth in what continues to be a ""very challenging environment."" Here's what Target reported, compared to Wall Street estimates, based on Bloomberg consensus data: Revenue: $31.40 billion versus $30.46 billion expected Adjusted earnings per share: $1.89 versus $1.48 expected Same-store sales: 0.7% versus -1.74% expected Brick & mortar same-store sales: up 1.9% versus -2.80% expected Cornell said having multiple category offerings, including food & beverage, in addition to beauty and household items served the retailer well this past quarter, Cornell said. ""Strength in Food & Beverage, Beauty and Household Essentials offset ongoing softness in discretionary categories. This performance highlights the benefit of our multi-category merchandise assortment, which drives relevance with our guests in any environment, and is a key reason we grew traffic every quarter last year."" Same-store sales beat estimates, up 0.7% compared to expectations of a decline of 1.74%. Same-store sales at physical locations also got a boost, up 1.9%, while digital sales dropped 3.6% in Q4. At the end of Q4, inventory was 3% lower than 2021. Meanwhile, in discretionary categories like electronics, home and apparel, inventory was nearly 13% lower than 2021, ""partially offset by higher inventory in frequency categories."" For full-year fiscal 2022 results, revenue grew by $3 billion, to $109 billion. Compared to 2019, revenue is up more than $30 billion. In the full-year, same-store sales increased 2.2%, while traffic was up 2.1%. Looking ahead to fiscal 2023, Cornell said the retailer is focused on it's long-term strategy and ""continued differentiation through affordability, assortment, ease and convenience"" as it competes with other retailers for consumers trading down. ""At the same time, we’re planning our business cautiously in the near term to ensure we remain agile and responsive to the current operating environment...as we plan for the year ahead, we will continue to make robust capital investments and pursue efficiency opportunities in support of our long-term growth."" For the first-quarter of 2023, the company expects a wide range for same-store sales, from a low-single digit decline to a low-single increase, and an operating income margin rate of 4-5%. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.50 to $1.90. For fiscal-year 2023, the company expects same-store sales to be the same, from low-single digit to a low-single increase, along with an operating income of more than $1 billion and adjusted EPS to range from $7.75 to $8.75. In the next 3 years, the company aims to move beyond its pre-pandemic operating income margin rate of 6%, and says it could possibly reach that goal as early as fiscal 2024, ""depending on the speed of recovery for the economy and consumer demand."" — Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose by 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.2%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased by 0.6%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked down to 3.93% Monday. On the economic data side, new orders for manufactured durable goods in January plunged to 4.5%, the biggest drop since April 2020, the Census Bureau reported. The drop was more pronounced than economist estimates of 4.0%. ""The manufacturing sector will remain under pressure in the months ahead, but the details of January's report of durable goods orders and shipments suggest factory activity started the year on a better note than the headline figure would suggest,"" Lydia Boussour, EY Parthenon senior economist, wrote in a statement following the release. Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors’ index of pending home sales climbed 8.1% to 82.5 in January, sharply higher from the projected rise of 1.0% by Bloomberg economists, according to data the group released on Monday. On a yearly basis, however, pending transactions plunged by nearly 24%. ""The increase in the Pending Home Sales Index confirms that the US housing market has improved, or better put, has somewhat stabilized over the last several months due to lower mortgage interest rates,"" Raymond James chief economist Eugenio Aleman wrote in statement to Yahoo Finance. ""However, the recent increase in mortgage rates is probably going to inflict some more pain on the US housing market going forward."" Stocks closed out their worst week of 2023 on Friday after the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge showed it unexpectedly accelerated in January and consumer spending jumped. The “core” Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index – which excludes volatile food and energy components – showed prices climbed 0.6% in January and 4.7% from last year. The Commerce Department also reported consumer spending rose 1.8% last month from December, the largest increase in nearly two years. The survey’s results renewed anxiety among investors that the Fed would continue its aggressive tightening campaign against inflation. The drop in optimism pressured the major indexes, as the Dow Jones dropped 3% for its fourth consecutive losing week, while the S&P 500 shed 2.7% in its worst week since early December and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.3%. Data compiled by 22V Research has found that rising interest rates have increased the correlation between growth and value stocks to the highest level since at least 2005. This week, investors will remain keen on the retail sector, with earnings from Target (TGT) on deck before market open on Tuesday after Walmart (WMT) warned of cautious profit guidance for the year ahead. Home improvement retail giant Home Depot (HD) also had disappointing guidance for fiscal 2023. Elsewhere on the earnings calendar are results from Costco (COST), Macy's (M), Dollar Tree (DLTR), and Kohl's (KSS) to feature the retail side. Meanwhile, the share of companies topping analysts' expectations in the fourth quarter has been low compared to history. Data from FactSet showed that 68% of S&P 500 companies reported fourth quarter earnings that beat expectations, down from the five-year average of 77% and the 10-year average of 73%. In single stock moves, Seagen Inc. (SGEN) shares jumped Monday morning after a report from The Wall Street Journal said Pfizer (PFE) is in early-stage talks to acquire the cancer drugmaker company in what could be a multi-billion dollar deal. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK-B) stock rose following CEO Warren Buffett’s annual letter to shareholders, which offered readers a glimpse into his views on share buybacks, taxes, corporate accounting, and his sense of optimism about the economy. Shares of fuboTV (FUBO) sank after the sports-focused streaming service issued disappointing guidance in its fourth-quarter earnings report on Monday and disclosed that it had sold stock at a deeply discounted price. Fisker (FSR) shares jumped Monday after the electric vehicle startup announced its deliveries for its first vehicle, the Ocean SUV, would be completed by spring. Shares of Union Pacific (UNP) climbed after the largest freight operator announced its plans to name a new chief executive following pressure from activists to oust Lance Fritz from the job. Bath & Body Works (BBWI) shares fell after the company said in a letter to shareholders that the looming proxy battle is based on ""misguided"" motivations and would be detrimental to shareholders. The board made the decision to not appoint former Third Point co-chief investment officer Munib Islam. Elsewhere, in cryptocurrency news, Coinbase (COIN) said in a tweet that it will soon suspend trading for Binance's stablecoin, Binance USD, on March 13 at or around noon ET. The move comes after Paxos Trust disclosed it will stop creating the Binance-branded stablecoin, citing regulatory pressure. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. Salesforce is facing a defining moment in its 24-year history. Growth is slowing. Analysts are worried fundamentals will get worse before they get better as companies curtail tech spending amid a sluggish global economy. A fresh round of layoffs at Salesforce have just been uncorked....at a company that has only known aggressive hiring. Employees are questioning leadership at the tech titan. Co-CEO Bret Taylor is no longer co-CEO of Salesforce — instead he's off to launch an AI startup the serial entrepreneur tells me. Slack founder Stewart Butterfield, who stayed on when the company was acquired by Salesforce, is still founder...but no longer with the parent company. Salesforce co-founder Marc Benioff is back at the CEO helm, after attempting again to pullback from day to day duties (by delegating to a co-CEO) and focus more on his vast philanthropic ventures. To top it all off the company is staring down the barrel of five sharks in the field of activist money management: Elliott Management, Starboard Value, Inclusive Capital, ValueAct, and Third Point. This is an unprecedented activist versus public company battle, pros have told Yahoo Finance. How it ends is wildly unclear, but is a situation just as important as Wednesday's earnings report. ""While the involvement of five activist investors has likely been the primary driver of CRM stock of late, quarterly results probably still matter (though not as much as usual), and how those results are delivered may be more relevant than ever,"" said Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci. Below, Yahoo Finance breaks down this complicated situation at large-cap tech name Salesforce. The drama is high, and it could all be coming down to one final epic conclusion. What Yahoo Finance Is Watching: Salesforce Earnings What sources tell us is top of mind on the Street: How quickly are sales deteriorating inside of the broader tech pullback? What does the pipeline of future business look like? Does Marc Benioff acknowledge the activist situation? Are more layoffs needed? Consensus is that Salesforce warns on sales and earnings for 2023 – but how bad is it? The Vibe Among Wall Street Analysts Analysts are generally expecting a muted tone from Salesforce on earnings day. “For Benioff and Salesforce the actual quarter and FY24 take a back seat to the fluid activist situation which is happening at Salesforce with the Street's patience wearing thin after a head scratcher Slack deal and slowing growth/underachieving margins front and center.” -Wedbush analyst Dan Ives ""Key to the Q4 call is gaining clarity on the extent to which management will turn the dial up on non-GAAP operating margins, GAAP profitability, and any future share repurchases with the emergence of activist involvement in the stock."" -Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss What the Activists Want From Salesforce Sources tell Yahoo Finance that Starboard Value — led by veteran activist investor and Papa John's chairman Jeff Smith — has been disappointed in Salesforce’s expense management, but isn’t advocating for a sale of Slack. Other activists involved in the situation are keen to see a Slack sale even at a low price as a show of faith by management they will improve margins, sources say. Overall, we are told the activists are entrenched and want clear changes from Salesforce leadership. Key thing the activist pool wants: Higher profit margins Realistic 2023 guidance Clear succession plan from CEO co-founder Marc Benioff Like we said, this earnings report is a defining moment in the history of Salesforce.

2023-02-26,tsla,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stocks-under-pressure-retail-earnings-continue-what-to-know-this-week-142308388.html,"The 2023 stock market rally is under pressure. Inflation data last week that topped expectations — as well as a continued drop in optimism the Federal Reserve's rate hikes will end sooner rather than later — pressured the major indexes with the Dow logging a fourth-straight losing week and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq suffering their worst weeks of the year, losing 2.7% and 3.4%, respectively. The Dow endured its worst weekly performance since Sept. 2022. In the week ahead, investors will remain keyed in on the retail sector, with results from Target (TGT) in focus after rival Walmart (WMT) issued a warning on the state of U.S. consumers last week. On the economic data side, a crowded calendar of reports from the housing and manufacturing sectors — two areas of the economy which have most reflected the impact of policy tightening — is on tap along with a key measure of consumer confidence. On Friday, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index — the Fed's preferred assessment of how quickly prices are rising across the economy — showed prices rose 0.6% during the month of January and 5.4% over last year. On a ""core"" basis, which strips out volatile food and energy components, prices rose 0.6% for the month and at an annual clip of 4.7%. The week marked a turning point in sentiment around inflation expectations and the path forward for interest rates. The hotter-than-expected PCE index followed upside surprises to inflation this year from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and producer prices, which showed the largest increases in several months to start the year. ""The bear market rally that began in October from reasonable prices and low expectations has morphed into a speculative frenzy based on a Fed pause/pivot that isn't coming,"" Morgan Stanley's top strategist Mike Wilson said in a note to clients last week. Wilson's forecast sees the S&P 500 bottoming out at 3,000 this year. On Friday, the benchmark U.S. equity index closed at 3,970. ""Investor optimism had already been hit by a slow puncture this week but it's deflating more rapidly as the latest data indicates that the work in taming inflation is far from over,"" Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in a note. Standout economic data releases in the week ahead include the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index, ISM's manufacturing PMI, and The Conference Board's consumer confidence reading for February. On the corporate side, Target will release its fourth-quarter earnings results before market open on Tuesday with results from Costco (COST), Macy's (M), Dollar Tree (DLTR), and Kohl's (KSS) also featuring on the retail side. Last week, Walmart's CFO John David Rainey said the ""consumer is still very pressured, and if you look at economic indicators, balance sheets are running thinner and savings rates are declining relative to previous periods."" ""We expect Target's results will look similar to Walmart's, with better-than-expected sales, more gross margin pressure than predicted, and solid opex leverage in the store,"" Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe said in a note.

2023-02-24,tsla,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-today-february-24-2023-104349492.html,"U.S. stocks tumbled Friday after the Federal Reserve's most closely watched inflation measure came in stronger than expected, in another sign that price pressures have become sticky into 2023. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) sank 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) plopped more than 300 points, or 1%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid 1.7%. Friday marked the worst week for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq since December. U.S. Treasury yields scrambled higher following the reading. The 2-year note surged 12 basis points to 4.81% while the 10-year note gained 7 basis points to top 3.95%. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index — the Fed's preferred assessment of how quickly prices are rising across the economy — rose 0.6% in January and 5.4% from last year. On a ""core"" basis, which strips out volatile food and energy components, prices rose 0.6% for the month and 4.7% from last year. The report from the Commerce Department also showed that consumer spending rose 1.8% last month from December after falling the previous month. The numbers support recent indications inflation is not falling at the pace and extent investors have been hoping for, even as prices have stabilized from the peaks of the current inflation cycle. “First December CPI was revised higher, and now each reading for January surprised to the upside. Inflation’s like an old boyfriend or girlfriend that keeps showing up when you don’t want to see them,"" David Russell, Vice President of Market Intelligence at TradeStation said in a note. In individual stock moves, Block (SQ) rose 4.3% after the payments processor reported fourth-quarter financial results that saw profit and revenue top expectations. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) shares fell 1% after the media giant posted a big revenue loss for the final three months of the year. Boeing (BA) shares closed down 4.8% after the airline manufacturer said it paused deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner jets because of a documentation issue. Beyond Meat's (BYND) stock rallied 10% after better-than-expected earnings and CEO Ethan Brown said the company is seeing progress in its efforts to cut costs and manufacturing hurdles. Beleaguered used car retailer (CVNA) plunged 20.5% after reporting a net loss that was nine times wider in the fourth quarter. The bumpier-than-anticipated road to restoring price stability and strong economic data to start the year — nonfarm payrolls rose by 517,000 in January while retail sales surged 3% — have prompted investors to readjust expectations around the path forward for interest rates, putting a dent in the market's recent momentum. The S&P 500 snapped a four-day losing streak on Thursday as stocks closed higher. But earlier this week on Tuesday, stocks had their worst day of the year. ""Equity bulls and even Chair Powell have bragged about anchored expectations for inflation and how consumers and investors believe it is moving in the right direction,"" Morgan Stanley Chief Investment Officer Lisa Shalett said in a note earlier this week, noting that January's Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) raised questions about whether inflation progress is stalling. ""Given data crosscurrents, the central bank needs to tread carefully. Investors still wagering on a 'Fed put; or quick return to financial repression are apt to be wrong this time,"" Shalett said. ""Fed credibility is on the line, and it is likely to risk overshooting rather than quitting the inflation fight too early."" — Alexandra Semenova is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-02-24,tsla,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/fed-inflation-fight-longer-pce-index-173353572.html,"Two Federal Reserve officials suggested Friday morning that inflation could persist longer than thought after the central bank's most closely watched inflation gauge surged by the most in months. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Fed Governor Philip Jefferson said they remain concerned about an inflation rate that remains well above the Fed's 2% year-over-year target. Mester reiterated that while inflation has moderated, the overall level remains too high. She noted recent research from the Cleveland Fed and a discussion paper that have suggested inflation could be more persistent than currently anticipated. “I see the risks to the inflation forecast as tilted to the upside and the costs of continued high inflation as being significant,” Mester said at the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum in New York. “So in my view, at this point, with the labor market still strong, the costs of undershooting on policy or prematurely loosening policy still outweigh the costs of overshooting.” The comments came as the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation – the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index – unexpectedly accelerated in January, rising 5.4% last month on an annual basis. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the inflation gage rose 4.7%, both marking pickups after several months of declines. On a monthly basis, the PCE index rose 0.6% in January compared with December. Core prices also rose 0.6% in January from the prior month, compared with December’s 0.4% increase. The numbers Friday came a week after the government released the Consumer Price Index, which showed a similar pickup in the inflation rate. The hot read on inflation hit markets on renewed rate hike fears, with the Dow Jones Industrial average tanking 336 points. ""By betting on a terminal rate above 5.35%, the market is effectively betting that the recent momentum in both growth and inflation will be sustained through the summer,"" Jefferies chief economist Aneta Markowska said. Mester, who does not vote on monetary policy decisions this year, told Bloomberg in an interview Friday morning that the latest inflation reading shows the Fed needs to keep raising interest rates but stopped short of suggesting it required a 50-basis-point rate hike at the next policy meeting in March. Mester said last week she wanted to raise the benchmark policy rate by 50 basis points at the last policy meeting to try to get to the peak rate faster, though she also didn't want to surprise markets. In a separate interview Friday morning with CNBC, Mester signaled her forecast in December to raise rates a bit above 5% hasn’t changed much. Speaking at the same Monetary Policy Forum on Friday, Boston Fed President Susan Collins said inflation is still too high and that the Fed has more work to do. “Inflation remains too high, and recent data …all reinforce my view that we have more work to do, to bring inflation down to the 2 percent target,” said Collins. “I anticipate further rate increases to reach a sufficiently restrictive level, then holding there for some, perhaps extended, time.” Also speaking at the conference, Jefferson said a limited supply of workers for jobs needed, which has pushed up wages, suggests inflation may cool slowly. “The ongoing imbalance between the supply and demand for labor, combined with the large share of labor costs in the services sector, suggests that high inflation may come down only slowly,” he said. Jefferson also said the forces driving inflation now are different that past inflationary episodes and therefore economic models won’t be as helpful to policymakers. Jefferson said the current situation is different because the pandemic created unprecedented disruptions to global supply chains and is having a long-lasting impact on the labor participation rate. “The inflationary forces impinging on the U.S. economy at present represent a complex mixture of temporary and more long-lasting elements that defy simple, parsimonious explanation,” he said. Jefferson says he thinks the Fed is addressing the spike in inflation proactively, unlike in the 1970s and has more credibility now.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. What's old may be new again for U.S. stock investors. The end of zero-interest rate policies (ZIRP) is likely to mark a shift in equity market favorites from long-leading technology names to sectors like energy, materials and housing — or what strategists at Bank of America deem part of ""the old economy."" ""Bear markets have historically resulted in leadership change, which suggests old economy sectors are likely the winners of this cycle,"" Savita Subramanian, BofA’s head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy said in a note earlier this week. With these components of the market depleted of capital over the past ten years as Big Tech was powered by free money, the ""pendulum is expected to swing back"" in their direction, Subramanian noted. Despite the big gains across January in these very stocks that were battered throughout 2022, investors have called the moves higher this year a bear market rally rather than the start of a new bull market. ""I think the stock market is in a protracted bear market,"" DoubleLine Capital founder and CEO Jeffrey Gundlach told Yahoo Finance Live in an interview Wednesday (video above), adding it began in the fourth quarter of 2021. ""[It's] very negative for the stock market when you have rising interest rates against these valuations, especially real interest rates,"" Gundlach said, adding a pause in the increase in real rates this fall was a catalyst for the recovery in risk assets. ""But it looks like real interest rates might start rising again."" Meanwhile on Sunday, Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson told clients in a not that the recent rally was ""a speculative frenzy"" based on false hopes for a pivot by the Federal Reserve. Equity markets are in the throes of a recent shift in the narrative for where interest rates will go, finally taking Fed officials at face value as they vow to lift their policy rate above 5% this year. Bank of America indicated its analysis of equity risk premium shows growth stocks were not pricing in recession risk and the expected higher-for-longer rate environment is projected to pressure long-duration growth stocks. Whatever the rest of the year holds for the U.S. stock market, signs have already emerged of an imminent change in leadership. Last year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average crushed the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite, for example, falling less than 10% in 2022 while the latter index wiped out more than one third of its value. As Yahoo Finance’s Jared Blikre pointed out, the Dow’s outperformance relative to the tech index was by far the biggest gap since the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. Goldman Sachs’s chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin warned in November that the ""exceptionalism of technology is arguably behind us. In 2022, the aggregate market capitalization of the current ""tetrad of largest stocks,"" as Goldman Sachs put it — Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) – fell to 18% from 22% the prior year. And those top four stocks lost an aggregate -25% compared to -13% for the remaining stocks in the index during the period. ""With the end of ZIRP, we see the pendulum swinging back to the old economy as prolonged underinvestment has led to supply issues in the old economy,"" Subramanian said. Bank of America itself raised metals to overweight, and is overweight energy, a testament to its confidence in the leadership transition.

2023-03-10,tsla,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/tesla-supplier-catl-smashes-profit-024530944.html,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. reported annual earnings that beat estimates on stronger demand for cleaner cars, underscoring its dominance as the world’s biggest maker of batteries for electric vehicles.

Here's Everything We Know About the Bank Right Now SVB Races to Prevent Bank Run as Funds Advise Pulling Cash The Tesla Inc. supplier on Thursday reported net income for the 12 months ended Dec. 31 of 30.72 billion yuan ($4.4 billion), an increase of 92.9% from the previous year. That beat the median analyst estimate of 28.8 billion yuan, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and was in line with CATL’s preliminary guidance in January for profit between 29.1 billion yuan to 31.5 billion yuan. Revenue came in at 328.6 billion yuan, up 152% and in line with analysts’ forecasts. CATL’s core power battery business, which in 2021 accounted for the majority of the company’s sales, generated margins of 17.2%, matching market estimates. Shares in CATL surged as much as 3.3% Friday despite a broader EV rout sparked by a round of steep price cuts that have stirred worries about overcapacity. CATL commanded a 37% share of the global market for EV batteries in 2022, testimony to the popularity of its cheaper-to-produce lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries. In joint second place, with 13.6% each, are South Korea’s LG Energy Solution Ltd. and China’s BYD Co., the Warren Buffett-backed company that also makes cars, according to SNE Research data. The size and dominance of CATL — which recently sealed a deal to build a plant with Ford Motor Co. in the US — has caught the attention of Chinese President Xi Jinping, who in rare remarks offered at annual parliamentary meetings in Beijing earlier this week said he viewed its leading position with “joy and worry.” Read more: Ford’s Path to China Deal: A Surprise Biden Boost, Pelosi Furor CATL also reported a strong performance in its fast-growing energy storage segment, which generated revenue of 45 billion yuan, ahead of expectations. That’s an area of the business that billionaire Chairman Zeng Yuqun is taking a keener interest in, recently calling for stricter standards — a move that could benefit his firm at the expense of smaller rivals. Read more: CATL Chairman Urges Beijing to Review Energy Storage Standards Based in Ningde, Fujian province, CATL is facing intensifying competition in the battery space. Those dynamics are in part being spurred by CATL itself, which reportedly has been offering discounts to some Chinese carmakers against the backdrop of tumbling prices for raw materials like lithium, where it has direct investments. In comments to investors Friday, the battery maker clarified that recent rebates to some carmakers were aimed at sharing lithium mineral resources with long-term strategic clients. What Bloomberg Intelligence says: CATL’s battery profitability can recover further in 2023 on falling materials costs and greater economies of scale. We expect CATL’s battery sales volume to surge another 40-50% after more than doubling last year, fueled by robust demand from EVs as China extends a zero-purchase tax after ending Covid-Zero. - Steve Man and Joanna Chen, BI auto analysts Click here for the research Citibank analysts led by Jack Shang, which maintains a buy rating on the stock, said CATL believed its competitive advantage versus peers were widening in comments during a post-earnings investor call. “We prefer battery leader CATL with strong pricing power and access to overseas customers,” said Shang in a note Friday. Read more: China to Scrutinize Ford-CATL Deal to Ensure Top Tech Not Shared Jefferies Financial Group Inc.’s Johnson Wan, which downgraded CATL, remained unimpressed with its battery business margins, and foresaw pressure ahead, he said in a note Friday. Being the industry behemoth means CATL is particularly exposed to geopolitical risk, especially with the US seeking to limit reliance on Chinese companies in the EV supply chain and encouraging automakers to manufacture in North America.

Meanwhile, CATL is on a global expansion push, with 13 production bases around the world including in Germany and Hungary, according to its website, and five R&D centers. It’s mulling a Swiss GDR fundraise of up to $6 billion to fuel its many capital investments. (Updates with comments to investors in 8th paragraph.)

2023-03-10,tsla,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/know-beyond-why-tesla-inc-140002865.html,"Tesla (TSLA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future. Over the past month, shares of this electric car maker have returned -16.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which Tesla falls in, has lost 14.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Earnings Estimate Revisions Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. Tesla is expected to post earnings of $0.86 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -19.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.96 points to a change of -2.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.09 indicates a change of +28.6% from what Tesla is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged. Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Tesla is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: 12 Month EPS Projected Revenue Growth Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial. For Tesla, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $23.58 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +25.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $101.42 billion and $122.83 billion estimates indicate +24.5% and +21.1% changes, respectively. Last Reported Results and Surprise History Tesla reported revenues of $24.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +37.2%. EPS of $1.19 for the same period compares with $0.85 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.48%. The EPS surprise was +9.17%. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period. Valuation Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects. Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is. The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Tesla is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. Conclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Tesla. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price. As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Alibaba is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. Bottom Line The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alibaba. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

2023-03-10,tsla,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/nvidia-corporation-nvda-trending-stock-140002083.html,"Nvidia (NVDA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term. Shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +4.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.8% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Nvidia belongs, has gained 2.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Earnings Estimate Revisions Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.92 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -32.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.1%. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.48 points to a change of +34.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +4.1%. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.98 indicates a change of +33.4% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.6%. Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nvidia is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: 12 Month EPS Projected Revenue Growth Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial. For Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.51 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -21.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $29.78 billion and $36.83 billion estimates indicate +10.4% and +23.7% changes, respectively. Last Reported Results and Surprise History Nvidia reported revenues of $6.05 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -20.8%. EPS of $0.88 for the same period compares with $1.32 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.01 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.61%. The EPS surprise was +8.64%. Over the last four quarters, Nvidia surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period. Valuation Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects. Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is. The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Nvidia is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

SVB stock plummeted 68% during Friday's premarket trading session before the halt after dropping more than 60% through Thursday, closing at $106 per share. CNBC's David Faber reported early Friday SVB's planned capital raise announced earlier this week had not cleared the market, and that the firm was now seeking to sell itself. Turmoil for SVB began when the California based bank filed a surprise announcement of a $1.8 billion loss following a deposit outflow and plans to raise $2.25 billion by selling common and preferred stock. Silicon Valley Bank primarily serves startups and technology firms, which have been under pressure as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.  Silicon Valley’s CEO Greg Becker urged calm with venture capitalists Thursday in a call, according to The Information, and asked them not to withdraw money. Bloomberg reported that venture capitalists have urged portfolio companies to trim their exposure to the lender. Another California bank that serves cryptocurrency clients, Silvergate Capital, announced a “voluntary liquidation” Wednesday, the same day Silicon Valley Bank announced its ill-fated capital raise. Shares were also halted in Signature Bank (SBNY), a New York institution that serves some cryptocurrency clients, after its shares dropped more than 16%. First Republic Bank (FRC), which serves some companies in the venture world and also targets high-net worth clients from the tech industry, saw shares fall as much as 40% early Friday. Concerns about risks to other banks spread on Thursday as stocks of giant financial institutions tumbled. A major bank index fell by the most Thursday in nearly three years. Shares for JP Morgan Chase (JPM) fell 5.41% Thursday and shares were roughly flat during Friday's open. Shares of Bank of America (BAC) fell 6.20% Thursday and opened Friday down more than 2%. Citigroup (C) shares fell 4.20% Thursday and opened Friday down more than 1%. Shares of Goldman Sachs Group (GS) fell 7.20% Thursday and an additional 2% Friday. In a Friday morning note, Morgan Stanley analysts said they don’t anticipate this SVB Financial’s challenges will cripple other regional banks. “The funding pressures facing SIVB are highly idiosyncratic and should not be viewed as a read-across to other regional banks,” according to the note. “We do not believe there is a liquidity crunch facing the banking industry, and most banks in our coverage have ample access to liquidity.” David Hollerith is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Futures tied to the S&P 500 (^GSPC) were down 0.2% ahead of the open, while futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined 0.3%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) edged up by 0.1%. January’s job report blew past expectations, as the U.S. economy added more than half a million jobs and the unemployment rate dipped to 3.4%, a level not seen since 1969. But economists aren’t expecting another surprise for Friday’s February jobs print. Consensus estimates from economists are for job gains of 225,000, a slower pace from the January’s blowout number. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.4%. “Signs of slowing outnumber signs of strength, making the chance that last month was a fluke likely,” Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, wrote in a note Friday morning. “At the same time, labor demand continues strong, which suggests a significant drop is also unlikely. A return to the previous trend makes the most sense.” The Federal Reserve has been keeping a close eye on all fronts to the labor market as the central bank tries to cool down inflation. The Friday’s jobs print will show whether January’s hiring gain was an outlier or the start of economic acceleration. Another key point of focus will be wage growth — and whether or not the trend accelerated last month. Meanwhile, other recent data continues to show the economy remains resilient. Consumer spending surged in January, inflation stayed sticky, and business activity expanded in February. The accumulation of economic data, coupled with comments this week from Chair Jerome Powell, has sparked the debate on whether a 0.25% or 0.50% rate hike from the Fed is likely for its March meeting. However, recent events in the banking world have spurred other concerns for Fed officials as their monetary tightening policy induces stresses into the banking system. A major tech firm lender revealed it’s in deep trouble. Silicon Valley Bank’s (SIVB) share price tanked 60% on Thursday, wiping out $9.6 billion of market value after announcing it needs to raise $2.25 billion to offset a $1.8 billion loss on some bond sales. The sour sentiment has spread across markets as the KBW Bank index (^BKX) was down over 7%, while index members including Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) edged lower Friday morning in premarket trading.

Economists expect nonfarm payrolls grew by 225,000 last month with the unemployment rate expected to hold steady at 3.4%, according to data from Bloomberg. The BLS will release its latest jobs figures at 8:30 a.m. ET. Here are the key figures investors will be looking for in Friday's report compared to January's figures, according to data from Bloomberg: Nonfarm payrolls: +225,000 vs. +517,000 Unemployment rate: 3.4% vs. 3.4% Average hourly earnings, month-on-month: +0.3% vs. +0.3% Average hourly earnings, year-on-year: +4.7% vs. +4.4% Labor force participation rate: 62.4% vs. 62.4% Average weekly hours worked: 34.6 vs. 34.7 Investors will be paying particularly close attention to revisions to January's data released Friday morning, as investors saw the unexpectedly strong 517,000 jobs created to start the year as a potential outgrowth of seasonal adjustment factors or favorable weather. ""Given the potential impact of weather and seasonality effects in January there is the possibility of another shock last month, albeit mainly to the downside this time,"" wrote Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients earlier this month. Ashworth expects job gains in February will tally 200,000 just below consensus estimates. Friday's report also comes less than two weeks before the Federal Reserve's next policy meeting, with markets now expecting the central bank will raise interest rates by a more aggressive 0.50%. Fed Chair Jay Powell told lawmakers this week ""the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated."" Data from the CME Group shows markets pricing in an 60% of a 0.50% rate hike on March 22.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. For the last year, the Federal Reserve has tried to accomplish one goal, using one tool — lower inflation by raising interest rates. The result has been benchmark interest rates rising by 4.5% in a year and headline inflation falling from a peak of 9.1% in June to 6.4% as of January. As Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated in testimony on Capitol Hill this week, there is still work to be done for the Fed to achieve its goal. But over the last week, acute challenges at two banks have surfaced another issue now facing the Powell Fed. And that is the stability of the financial system. On Wednesday, Silvergate Capital (SI), which had become one of the crypto industry's biggest banking partners, announced it will liquidate and wind down operations after suffering significant deposit outflows from its digital asset clients. That same day, Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB), the preferred banking partner of the venture and startup worlds, announced it would take a $1.8 billion loss while liquidating its entire short-term securities book and raising $2.25 billion fresh capital. In a letter to investors, CEO Greg Becker assured investors the bank had ""ample liquidity,"" and said it took these actions ""because we expect continued higher interest rates, pressured public and private markets, and elevated cash burn levels from our clients as they invest in their businesses."" The Information reported Thursday afternoon Becker told investors on a call, ""I would ask everyone to stay calm and to support us just like we supported you during the challenging times."" Few statements have a tougher audience than investors being told to remain calm in times of market stress. On Thursday, U.S. stocks got crushed during a steady, relentless sell-off that centered on the financial sector. Regional banks were hammered. Big banks were hammered. The S&P 500 fell 1.8%. Bitcoin fell 7%. The challenge for Powell, however, is that some of the stress facing Silicon Valley Bank has been induced by the Fed's actions to fight inflation. And the fear is they may not be alone. In the simplest terms, Silicon Valley Bank took a nearly $2 billion hit selling bonds at a loss to buy different bonds that offer a higher yield. The firm's latest annual report showed the bank owned about $14 billion in Treasury securities with an average maturity between 1-5 years. Today, 1-year Treasury bills yield 5.25%. One day's drop in the stock market, of course, is not cause for concern about the financial system. Even the liquidation of one bank and deep investor concerns about another need not constitute a Fed-level worry about the U.S. banking system. But these moves serve as reminders that while the central bank's role in raising or lowering interest rates has become the focal point of investor attention over the last decade, the Fed also serves the central role in stabilizing markets and quelling investor fears during uncertain moments like the present. Almost exactly three years ago, Powell held an emergency Sunday night call on March 15, 2020 to announce a series of measures aimed at supporting the economy as the pandemic rapidly shut down global business. On that call, Powell reminded the assembled press, ""[That] central banks were originally designed to ...provide liquidity to financial systems in stress, so we take that job very seriously. It's probably the most important thing we're doing now is that."" Rising anxiety in the banking system as the ripples from a crypto collapse in 2022 and the icing over of a red hot venture market pale in comparison to the financial emergency the Fed faced three years ago. But their actions then were a reminder of the central bank's power, and, indeed, its centrality to financial markets. When the February jobs report is released Friday morning, investors will pore over the data to decipher whether a 0.25% or 0.50% rate hike from the Fed is likely warranted on March 22. This is the moment markets have been building towards for weeks. But the unforeseen stress now being injected into the banking system makes Friday and the days ahead notable for the Fed in an entirely different manner. That presents to Jay Powell another wrinkle in the challenge of trying to bring order to an economy that busted and boomed in a few short months.

2023-03-10,goog,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/why-silicon-valley-banks-crisis-is-rattling-americas-biggest-banks-121159393.html,"The problems of two small banks on the West Coast are rippling across markets and causing new investor concerns about some of the country’s largest financial institutions. Why? Three words: rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve’s aggressive campaign to bring down inflation helped set the stage for major problems at two California lending institutions — SVB Financial (SIVB) and Silvergate Capital (SI) — as an outflow of deposits forced both to sell assets at a loss. Those assets were bonds. Banks are big investors in assets like Treasury bills because they need lots of safe places to park their cash. Many financial institutions piled into these investments during a period of historically-low interest rates that spanned the early years of the pandemic, as banks took in tons of new deposits and lending was somewhat restrained. But now the Fed is hiking rates at a rapid clip, with Fed Chair Jay Powell warning earlier this week the central bank may have to speed up the pace of its rate increases to cool the economy further. The problem that creates for banks is simple: higher rates lower the value of their existing bonds. The withdrawals at SVB's Silicon Valley Bank have come from startups and technology firms, many of which also ran into new trouble once the Fed began raising rates. The deposit outflow forced SVB to sell assets and take a $1.8 billion loss, a move the bank it made “because we expect continued higher interest rates, pressured public and private markets, and elevated cash-burn levels from our clients as they invest in their businesses.” Its shares fell more than 60% Thursday. In pre-market trade on Friday SVB shares were down another 60% after overnight reporting from Bloomberg said VC firms ranging from Peter Thiel's Founder Fund to Union Square Ventures had told portfolio companies to pull their money from Silicon Valley Bank. Banks don't have to realize losses on bonds that may have gone down in value amid rising rates if they're not pushed to sell these assets. But Silvergate Capital and SVB Financial didn’t have that choice. Customer withdrawals at Silvergate Bank and SVB’s Silicon Valley Bank forced their hand. At Silvergate, which caters to cryptocurrency clients, customers yanked their money in the panic that followed the 2022 collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Silvergate said in January that it had realized losses of $886 million from selling securities as deposits fell. That weakened the bank considerably. On Wednesday it said it would wind down its bank, and its shares plunged Thursday. After disclosing the $1.8 billion loss and new capital raise, Silicon Valley’s CEO Greg Becker urged calm in a call with venture capitalists Thursday, according to The Information, asking these investors not to withdraw money. It now is seeking to raise $2.25 billion of new capital to cover the new losses. The concern now among investors is that much bigger banks could be forced to do the same. That sent the stocks of giant financial institutions tumbling Thursday, including the biggest of the big: JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC). A major bank index fell by the most Thursday in nearly three years. The biggest U.S. banks are much stronger than they were in the lead up to the last big banking crisis, in 2008, in part because regulators forced them to hold more capital and survive numerous stress test scenarios over the last decade and a half. And the giants have more diverse funding and customer bases than banks such as Silicon Valley or Silvergate, which gives them many more options during challenging times. Longtime banking analyst Mike Mayo said Thursday during an appearance on CNBC the biggest banks are ""a pillar of strength and stability"" and much more resilient than they were prior to the 2008 crisis. ""The biggest risks are outside the largest banks,"" he said, and yet all banks are ""getting painted with the same brush."" Bank stocks, he said, ""have gotten Powelled,"" referring to the Fed chair. ""Going from zero to 5% interest rates in a period that is faster than any time in four decades, you are going to have casualties."" Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chair Martin Gruenberg highlighted the new interest rate risks facing the industry during a speech on March 6, noting that unrealized losses on available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities totaled $620 billion at the end of 2022 across all U.S. banks. ""The current interest rate environment has had dramatic effects on the profitability and risk profile of banks’ funding and investment strategies,"" he said. ""First, as a result of the higher interest rates, longer term maturity assets acquired by banks when interest rates were lower are now worth less than their face values. The result is that most banks have some amount of unrealized losses on securities."" These unrealized losses, he added, ""weaken a bank’s future ability to meet unexpected liquidity needs."" The good news, according to Gruenberg, is that ""banks are generally in a strong financial condition, and have not been forced to realize losses by selling depreciated securities.""

At the closing bell, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down 1.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was off by 1.6%, or 542 points, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down by 2%. Through Thursday's close the market was on pace for its worst week of the year, Bloomberg data showed. The selling on Thursday accelerated throughout the trading session as a collapse in shares of SVB Financial (SIVB) pressured bank stocks and raised concerns over previously unforeseen knock-on effects from the Federal Reserve's rate hiking campaign on the financial system. On Wednesday, SVB announced a $2.25 billion capital raise and the sale of nearly all of its securities portfolio for a loss of $1.8 billion. The company's Silicon Valley Bank subsidiary is the bank for many startups and other players in the venture world. In a letter to investors on Wednesday, the company said: ""We are taking these actions because we expect continued higher interest rates, pressured public and private markets, and elevated cash burn levels from our clients as they invest in their businesses."" The Information reported Thursday afternoon Greg Becker, CEO of Silicon Valley Bank, said on a call with investors, ""I would ask everyone to stay calm and to support us just like we supported you during the challenging times."" Becker also reportedly told investors the bank has ""ample liquidity,"" but said that ""if everyone is telling each other SVB is in trouble, that would be a challenge."" SVB shares fell 60% on Thursday. This decline also weighed on regional banks, with the SPDR Regional Banking ETF (KRE) falling 8% while the SPDR Financial Sector ETF (XLF) fell some 4%. Among major U.S. money-center banks, shares of JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), and Wells Fargo (WFC) were all down more than 5% on Thursday. First Republic Bank (FRC), which maintains a large high net-worth clients business, saw shares fall 16% during Thursday's trading session. As Bloomberg's Jonathan Ferro tweeted, Thursday seems to have marked the moment in the rate-hiking cycle that higher rates are good for banks until they are no longer good. Earlier Thursday, labor market data had been the main catalyst for the market as investors await a crucial jobs report set for release Friday morning. The weekly report on initial filings for unemployment insurance Thursday morning showed 211,000 claims were filed last week, an increase of 21,000 from the prior weak and what economists at Oxford Economics called the ""first hint of weakness"" in this data. ""The jump in jobless claims to 211k last week from 190k is the first sign of weakness in the claims data this year but is still well short of the 300k+ level that would be consistent with a recession,"" Michael Pearce, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients. ""As the Fed presses ahead with more rate hikes, we expect layoffs to eventually rise significantly."" The initial pop from stocks following this data came after two days of testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made clear interest rates are likely to go higher than expected amid strong labor market and inflation data. Stocks finished Wednesday's trading session mixed after a sell-off Tuesday that was triggered by comments from Powell suggesting the Fed will need to raise rates higher than previously forecasted amid stubborn inflation. ""I was surprised by Powell's willingness to accelerate the policy tightening pace, but I am not surprised by the admission that terminal rates will need to rise further,"" said Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro. ""At present, the futures market is priced for a [50 basis point] move in March. There is no point cracking open a door if you don’t intend to walk through."" Data from the CME Group shows markets placing an 80% on the Fed raising rates by 0.50% later this month. Elsewhere in markets, WTI crude oil fell about 1.5% to trade near $75.50 a barrel, a retreat from the $80 a barrel oil was trading near earlier this week. Investors were also keeping a close eye on the Treasury market with the 10-year yield firmer by about 5 basis points, trading at 3.92% after a move higher in yields earlier this week led to a deepening inversion of the yield curve. In single-stock news, shares of Silvergate (SI) were in focus on Thursday after the bank said late Wednesday it would liquidate and wind down its operations after suffering heavy losses amid huge deposit outflows from its digital asset client base.

Shares of SVB, whose operating segments include Silicon Valley Bank, slumped over 50% in their deepest one-day drop on record after the company announced a $1.75 billion share sale late on Wednesday. SVB is battling cash burn due to declining deposits from startups struggling with a venture capital funding drought. San Francisco headquartered First Republic slumped 15% after hitting its lowest level since October 2020. The SPDR S&P regional banking ETF dropped more than 7% to its lowest level since January 2021. Major U.S. banks were also hit, with JPMorgan and Bank of America both down more than 5%. First Republic and SVB were the S&P 500's deepest percentage decliners in Thursday's trading session, while JPMorgan's loss weighed more than any other stock on the S&P 500's 1.1% decline at mid-day. ""The Silicon Valley raise got everybody nervous about people's capital levels and what deposits are doing. A lot of institutional investors don't feel great about owning certain banks right now,"" said R.J. Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. ""It just gets people freaked out because Silicon Valley, historically has been a very strong, well-run bank. If they're having issues right now, people are wondering what about other banks that are lesser quality and that don't have the reputation that Silicon Valley Bank has.""

Add to that the expectation that rates could soon crest 7% if inflation remains a top concern. “It's not just higher mortgage rates, but really the combination of higher mortgage rates and still higher home prices in most markets that are creating hurdles for buyers,” Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale, told Yahoo Finance. “Even though a greater share of home sellers in today's market have adjusted their price lower, both listing and sale prices have continued to climb on a year-over-year basis.” While the volume of applications to purchase a home increased by 7% for the week ending March 3, overall purchase activity was 42% lower than a year ago, the Mortgage Bankers Association latest survey found. “Even with this jump in activity, both purchase and refinance applications remain well below year-ago levels when rates were much lower,” MBA President and CEO Bob Broeksmit told Yahoo Finance. “The recent increase in mortgage rates, right at the start of the busy spring buying season, could cause prospective buyers to delay decisions until rates moderate.” Buyers still in the market also have to contend with higher list prices from sellers. The national median listing price increased to $415,000 in February, Realtor.com data showed, up from $406,000 the previous month and up 7.8% year over year. That reverses several months of softening listing prices after peaking in June at $449,000, and could suggest that sellers are getting stubborn in offering incentives. Without wiggle room on prices, buyers are seeing their purchasing power evaporate amid rising interest rates. For instance, the monthly mortgage payment for a median-priced home is 49% higher than a year ago at last week’s rate of 6.65%, according to Realtor.com. Buyers are likely to face further affordability challenges entering the spring, Hale noted, because too-low inventory will continue to buoy home prices. “One big reason that home prices continue to climb is that even though we have more homes for sale today, the market is still not back to what was common before the pandemic in most places,” Hale said. “And fewer homes for sale mean there's still some pressure on prices even though buyers are more selective amid higher costs.” As homebuyer demand remains weak, home sellers are feeling more pessimistic and are much less active than last year. There were 15.9% fewer homes listed for sale in February compared with last year, data from Realtor.com showed. Meanwhile, there’s some evidence that sellers are a bit less generous with buyer incentives. For instance, 57% of builders used incentives to close sales in February, the National Association of Home Builders said, down from 62% in December and 59% in November. A growing share of sellers are also pulling back on price reductions, more so than what is typical during this time of the year. According to Realtor.com, 13% of home sellers issued a price cut in February, up from 5.4% a year ago. Still, in January at least 15.3% of sellers lowered their prices to make a sale. Mortgage rates have been marching higher since February after government data revealed the inflation remains a threat. This week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell made it clear to Congress that he isn’t ready to soften his aggressive fight on inflation, indicating that further rate hikes would likely be necessary as we enter the spring. That could likely keep mortgage rates higher. Though “forecasting is far more art than science,” Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com, anticipates that mortgage rates are likely to climb higher before they retreat later this year. “At present, and while there is a chance that rates could retreat to recent bottom levels or perhaps a little below at some point, much depends on what happens with prices, with the Fed, and ultimately whether or not the economy gets to a tipping point and starts to head into recession,” Gumbinger recently told Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-09,goog,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/9-ways-biden-is-set-to-raise-some-taxes-in-2024-budget-proposal-145357176.html,"President Biden is set to lay out vast and expensive ambitions in his 2024 budget Thursday from shoring up Medicare and boosting domestic spending to reducing the deficit by nearly $3 trillion over the coming decade. To pay for it all, he plans to propose a slate of tax increases, according to multiple peeks at the budget administration officials gave in recent days. There are new taxes on the business world focused on raising the rate on corporate income and on stock buybacks. He will also propose new taxes on wealthy Americans — from changes to how investment income is taxed to a revival of his ""billionaire minimum tax"" on wealth. “I want to make it clear I’m going to raise some taxes,” President Biden said during a recent stop in Virginia, offering one of his many previews of what's to come. Of course, presidential budget proposals are largely symbolic documents that are more about staking out a position rather than being enacted. But they serve as an important marker of Biden’s priorities for the year ahead. “What the president has really here to use is the bully pulpit, meaning once he puts his budget forward, is he going to continue to push some of those ideas?” asked Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget President Maya MacGuineas in a Yahoo Finance Live interview on Wednesday. “If he's serious about it, he'll push it.” Here are some of the new taxes set to be unveiled on Thursday In his budget, President Biden is set to renew his long-standing calls for more taxes on Corporate America. Included in a New York Times preview of the budget document are Biden’s desire to raise the corporate income tax rate to 28% from its current level of 21%. The president is also set to renew his call to quadruple the recently enacted excise tax on stock buybacks, a change he first offered earlier this year during his State of the Union address. On Jan. 1, a new 1% tax on share repurchases went into effect, but has done little to damp business enthusiasm for the practice. The provision is currently set to bring in about $74 billion over the coming decade, and Biden is proposing to increase the rate to 4%. And according to a document reviewed by Reuters, the budget will also propose scrapping tax breaks that oil and gas companies receive. That could likely open up another front in the back and forth between the White House and oil companies over record profits they've enjoyed since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The new proposals come after last year’s Inflation Reduction Act imposed multiple new taxes on businesses, including the 1% stock buyback excise tax and a new corporate book minimum tax. Going after more taxes so shortly after last year's victory likely will inflame critics. Erica York, a senior economist at the Tax Foundation, argued in an interview Wednesday with Yahoo Finance that Biden’s policies were already “heading in the wrong direction and the president's budget is going to double down on that.” “I would say wait and see how it plays out before you double down or quadruple down on it,” she added. Biden is also set to propose new taxes on Americans making over $400,000 a year. The president rolled out his most controversial proposal during this year’s State of the Union with a potential new tax that would target wealth, not just income. “We have to reward work, not just wealth,” President Biden said in his speech. “No billionaire should be paying a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter.” According to a preview offered to Bloomberg, the president will lay out new details on that, including a call for a 25% minimum tax on households worth more than $100 million as well as an increase in the capital gains rate for wealthy Americans. Other tax ideas that were present in previous budgets are set to be revived for 2024, including ending the so-called carried-interest loophole and eliminating some tax breaks around real-estate profits. All told, the various increases would fund nearly $3 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade and also fund other Biden priorities. The deficit reduction will come in a budget that “achieves this while lowering costs for families, investing in America, and protecting programs Americans have paid into because it proposes tax reforms to ensure the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share, while cutting wasteful spending on special interests — interests like Big Oil and Big Pharma,” Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Wednesday. Finally, the White House previewed new taxes to shore up the Medicare program earlier this week. Biden will propose increases on payroll taxes on Americans making over $400,000 per year; closing loopholes that shields some “pass-through” income from Medicare taxes; and allowing Medicare to negotiate on a wider array of prescription drugs. Those provisions, which Biden reviewed in a New York Times op-ed on Tuesday, would extend the program through 2050. Critics have noted that many of these proposals would be untested ways to fund the health care program for retirees. York also noted that some of the rule changes around the net investment income tax would help Medicare's finances by diverting some money from the government’s general fund. “Of course that looks like you're strengthening Medicare, but you're creating a hole in the budget elsewhere,” she said, noting the plan also increases the net investment income tax from 3.8% to 5% and would therefore also bring in more money overall. Republicans have been promising for weeks that Biden’s proposals won’t see the light of day. This is hardly new — there's an old saying in Washington about budgets that “the president proposes and Congress disposes” — but it will nevertheless increase pressure on House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) to offer his own proposal in the coming months. MacGuineas, who previewed the dueling proposals, noted that the White House budget will likely focus on tax increases and the GOP plan will revolve around spending cuts. “Neither of them is realistic, and, frankly, neither of them is the right policy,” she said. “We need compromises on both.” Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. Fed chair Jay Powell just poured cold water on the ""no landing"" crowd hoping to avert a U.S. recession and rally stocks to fresh record highs this year. After two days of grilling before Congress, investors have been reminded (again) that the Fed chief still sees inflation as a persistent, pernicious threat. Stocks and bonds took notice Wednesday, as both sold off amid surging short-term rates — leaving the major indices underwater for the week as of the close. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes,"" said Powell before the Senate. And with two weeks to go until the next Fed meeting, markets are now expecting exactly that. Bonds and derivatives are pricing in a more hawkish outcome — expecting the Fed to lift its benchmark rate 50 basis points instead of 25 basis points. Since Monday's settlement, the U.S. 2-year Treasury-Note yield has surged 18 basis points to 5.06% — the highest level since 2007. It also deepened its inversion over the 10-year yield, with the spread reaching negative 108 basis points (or -1.08 percentage points) — the highest since the early 1980s when Paul Volcker was the Fed chair fighting a similar battle over price inflation. Under normal conditions, interest rates of longer-term loans or bonds (the cost of money) are expected to be more expensive than their shorter-term counterparts, as risk is higher on the long end. But this changes when the Fed starts stamping out animal spirits, lifting short-term rates to restrict the creation of credit and eventually choke off growth. While the magnitude, or depth, of a yield curve inversion isn't necessarily predictive of a deeper, or longer recession, there are a host of other indicators in the bond market that are sounding alarm bells. Former bond trader and CEO of TheMacroCompass.com Alfonso Peccatiello recently joined Yahoo Finance Live to offer his insights. Peccatiello notes that the bond market expects the Fed to fight inflation and remain tight, with interest rates well over 5% a year from now. ""That cannot happen if a recession is unfolding. The Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates,"" he said. Essentially, the inflation-fighting credibility that Powell has earned in the markets comes with a cost — pushing expectations of Fed capitulation far beyond what occurs historically. ""The issue is — the tighter you keep borrowing conditions for the private sector, the higher you keep mortgage rates, the higher you keep corporate borrowing rates — the higher the chances you're going to freeze these credit markets and basically sleepwalk into an accident or, in general, accelerate a recession later on,"" said Peccatiello. But long before the Fed delivers relief in the form of cuts, Peccatiello expects stocks to suffer from an earnings recession, which, he says, ""isn't fully priced in."" (An earnings recession — marked by two consecutive quarterly declines in S&P 500 earnings — often, but not always precedes an economic recession.) Peccatiello believes the U.S. is already in an earnings recession, with stocks reflecting complacency. Nevertheless, he doesn't expect a disaster. He sees about 10% maximum downside risk in the S&P 500 down to the 3600 level, which is right around last year's lows. ""I don't think it's going to be much lower than that,"" he says, adding, ""[T]he stock market generally bottoms before earnings bottom."" The reason gets back to the Fed, which historically capitulates and slashes rates as earnings drop. The Fed rate cuts then get incorporated into better stock valuations, which eventually halt the decline in stock prices, Peccatiello added. ""[This] means the stock market can stop its decline and start slowly but surely moving into a new bull market.""

""We have not made any decision,"" he told the House Financial Services Committee, saying key reports on employment and inflation would govern any moves. The remarks came a day after he told the Senate Banking Committee that, ""we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes"" if the data supported it. That spurred traders to price in a higher chance of a 0.50% hike than a 0.25% increase later this month. “We're going to be looking at the totality of data,"" Powell said Wednesday during questioning from House members. ""We are not on a preset path,"" he added. Powell said the Fed wants to see the upcoming employment report Friday, along with key inflation reports on the consumer and producer price indexes, before making a judgment. On Wednesday, the Dow dropped 0.18%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.14%, and the Nasdaq rose 0.40%. When asked by Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D, Mass.) whether the Fed would pause interest rates to avoid a recession, the chairman called it a serious question and noted that he wouldn’t say yes or no. The Fed, he said, is not ""seeking a recession."" Powell also said the era of low interest rates is likely over. ""Now, we have the 10-year [Treasury yield] back close to 4%,"" said Powell. ""And I think, we need to be careful not to assume that these secular low, longer term rates, will continue indefinitely because it doesn't look likely now."" Democrats, including Democratic Ranking Member Maxine Waters (D, CA) asked him to comment on the prospect of a U.S. default if Congress is not able to raise the debt ceiling. Powell warned that the Fed can’t protect the economy from brinksmanship or a default. ""No one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the non-payment of the government's bills, let alone a debt default, which I don't think will happen, but no one should think we have the tools to protect against the effects of that,"" said Powell. When asked whether the Fed would accept a trillion-dollar coin to avoid a debt default, Powell said there are no rabbits to be pulled out of hats and that would be a ""rabbit coming out of a hat."" House Republicans expressed concerns about reviewing and potentially increasing capital requirements for banks. Patrick McHenry, the chairman of the House committee, questioned the motivation of a ""holistic review"" of these requirements from the Fed’s Vice Chair of Supervision Michael Barr, saying the Fed shouldn’t operate in the shadows when the regulation in question can have broad and significant economic effects. McHenry also accused the Fed of laying the groundwork for a new climate policy. ""The Fed needs to stick to its knitting,"" said McHenry. ""I agree there is concern for many that the Fed is picking up new needles and knitting partisan sweaters at such a precarious time for our economy here at home in the global economy. That would be a mistake."" Powell’s comments Wednesday were his last before the Fed’s policy meeting in two weeks.

2023-03-08,goog,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-march-8-2023-124051164.html,"U.S. stocks finished mixed on Wednesday, following two job prints that showed the labor market remains tight amid sticky inflation. Wall Street also heard from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday morning. Powell continued to stress that ""no decision"" has been made on the size of the Fed's upcoming interest-rate increase at its March policy meeting. ""When say we will look at the totality of data, that will include these next reports. We will carefully analyze. Haven't made a decision on the March meeting. Larger point is that we are not on a preset path,"" said Powell during his second day of testimony before Congress. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended the day up 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined by 0.2%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added 0.4%. Bond yields inched higher alongside a stronger dollar. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked up to 3.98% Wednesday. U.S. stocks plummeted Tuesday after Powell said during his Senate Banking Committee testimony that interest rates may rise “higher” than previously expected as the Fed continues a persistent fight against inflation. Powell’s comments on Capitol Hill triggered a 1.5% selloff in equities, according to JP Morgan’s trading desk. Tuesday’s losses saw every sector lower, with financials and real estate logging the biggest declines for the day. Treasury yields were higher, with the 2-year yield tipping above 5%, while the spread between the 10-year and 2-year US Treasury yields inverted for the first time since September 1981. According to strategists at Deutsche Bank, reaching this level signals a recession could be underway or has occurred within a maximum of eight months. “Powell’s speech indicates that the Fed will heavily depend on near-term data for upcoming rates decisions,” Michael Feroli, Chief U.S. Economist at JP Morgan, wrote in a note Wednesday morning. ""With January’s macro data mostly printing on the hawkish side, NFP Friday and CPI next Tuesday are the most critical catalysts for Fed’s decision between 25bp and 50bp,” Feroli added. Still, on the economic data side, ADP’s monthly read on private payroll growth rose by 242,000 in February, above consensus expectations for 200,000. ADP also tracked pay growth for those workers who stayed in their position, which decelerated to 7.2% last month, the slowest pace of gains within in the last year. “There is a tradeoff in the labor market right now,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist, ADP, wrote in the press release. ""We're seeing robust hiring, which is good for the economy and workers, but pay growth is still quite elevated. The modest slowdown in pay increases, on its own, is unlikely to drive down inflation rapidly in the near term.” Meanwhile, the U.S. monthly international trade deficit increased to $68.3 billion in January, below the consensus deficit of $68.7 billion as imports increased more than exports, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the U.S. Census Bureau. Another highlight Wednesday morning was January’s report on the number of job openings, which fell to 10.82 million, down from the upwardly revised 11.2 million openings in the prior month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. The construction, leisure, hospitality, and finance industries showed significant pullbacks in job openings. ""While the January JOLTS report shows job openings are heading in the right direction for the Fed, the decline is far too modest to convince that labor market conditions are cooling enough to bring down inflation,"" Matthew Martin, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a statement following the release. February’s jobs report out on Friday will hold more clues about the strength of the economy. Economists expect 215,000 new jobs will be added to the economy, a slower pace than January’s blowout number of 517,000 job additions. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.4%. Another key point from the reading will be wage growth, with a 0.3% month-to-month bump in average hourly earnings anticipated and 4.7% over the last year. In single-stock moves, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) gained over 2% Wednesday after a regulatory filing revealed that Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway bought nearly 6 million shares of the oil company in recent days, raising its stake in the company to 200.2 million shares worth $12.2 billion. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD) shares rose 3% Wednesday after the security software provider reported fourth-quarter earnings that topped analysts' expectations and issued stronger guidance for the fiscal first quarter. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) dipped 3% as Berenberg analyst Adrian Yanoshik slashed his rating on the stock from buy to hold, citing ""based on misplaced fears of a price war – appears to have been accepted by the market,"" Yanoshik noted. Separately, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened an investigation into the Model Y SUV over a concern with its steering wheels. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-08,goog,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/key-recession-indicator-yield-inversion-treasury-160255114.html,"The Treasury market is sending its sharpest warning about recession risks since 1981. On Tuesday, the difference in the yield on 2-year and 10-year Treasury notes further inverted, with the yield on the 10-year falling 103 basis points, or 1.03 percentage points, below the yield on the 2-year yield. This dynamic has preceded each of the last eight U.S. recessions. By this measure, the yield curve has been inverted since July of last year as investors bet aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve to combat inflation would tip the economy into recession. In an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled the central bank will likely be more aggressive than it previously forecast in raising interest rates this year as inflation proves stubborn and the labor market remains strong. ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,"" Powell told the Senate Banking Committee in prepared remarks. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes."" ""Although inflation has been moderating in recent months, the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy,"" Powell added. The Fed will announce its next policy decision on March 22, a statement that will also be accompanied by new projections on where Fed officials see interest rates headed over the rest of this year and the next two. Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients Tuesday that Powell ""opened the door for the central bank to accelerate the pace of rate hikes and raise the target range of the fed funds rate more than anticipated because of the recent hot data on job growth and inflation."" Sweet noted investors are now pricing in 100 basis points of additional rate hikes from the Fed this year, up from the 75 basis points previously expected by most economists. Data from the CME Group showed Wednesday morning markets are now pricing in a nearly 80% chance the Fed raises rates by 50 basis points, or 0.50%, at its meeting later this month. As Yahoo Finance's Brian Cheung noted last year, there is nothing about Treasury yields themselves, or the relationship between the yield at any two points along the curve, that signals recession. Rather, it is what yields imply about future interest rates — and in turn future economic growth — that offers worrying signs for investors. While it is hotly debated what, exactly, ""goes into"" the yield for any Treasury security, a simple axiom used by many investors says Treasury yields indicate what the expected average of the fed funds rate, or the Fed's benchmark interest rate, will be over a given time period. With the 2-year yield standing at around 5% as of Wednesday morning, this implies investors think the fed funds rate will be, on average, 5% over the next two years. Today, the fed funds rate stands at roughly 4.6%, as the Fed's target interest rate range is 4.5%-4.75% following its decision last month to raise rates an additional 25 basis points. Therefore, we can say investors are anticipating the Fed will raise rates to at least 5% and keep them there for two years, or raise rates above 5% for some period of time before cutting them such that the average Fed funds rate is 5%. Duke professor Campbell Harvey, who uncovered this ""recession indicator"" in the 1980s, told Bloomberg in an interview earlier this year he thinks the economy can avoid recession despite warnings coming from his work. In part, in Harvey's view, this is because market awareness of this indicator has lessened its potency as a predictive measure. Notably, Harvey's worked actually focused on the spread between the 3-month Treasury bill and the 10-year Treasury note as the most potent recession indicator, not the now-popular 2-year/10-year spread. The spread between these two tenors along the curve currently stands at minus 107 basis points, still a clear recession signal by Harvey's work.

In exchange for capturing this difference between the wholesale and retail cost of goods, retailers take on the financial risk of fronting money to one party while working to make it back and then some from another. At the scale of the U.S. consumer economy, the differences between an additional week in a quarter, an additional weekend in a month, or even an additional day in a year can be millions of dollars or more. And if the timing of a day or two can disrupt the financial fortunes of a business — meaning there can be just hours between profits and losses — then one can imagine the challenges faced by retailers during the supply chain disruptions that results from the pandemic. In 2021, the story was that retailers were unable to match consumer demand as the economy re-opened. In 2022, supply chains that got unstuck eventually left retailers with more stock than they needed. As 2023 gets underway, retailers are suggesting the balance may finally be just right. Sporting goods retailer Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) reported fourth quarter results Tuesday morning that impressed investors, with shares rising 11% after the company offered a full-year earnings forecast well above expectations. And driving this profit forecast were inventories that are in ""great shape"" ahead of the company's busy spring season. ""As planned, we continued to address targeted inventory overages, and as a result our inventory is in great shape as we start 2023. We couldn't be more excited about our spring assortment,"" said Lauren Hobart, president and CEO. Dick's CFO Navdeep Gupta added on a call with analysts Tuesday morning, ""We were chasing inventory last year amidst industry-wide supply chain disruptions. ...Compared to Q4 of 2019, a 38% increase in sales was well ahead of our 29% increase in inventory. Our inventory is healthy and well positioned."" Looking at economy-wide data, we can see inventory-to-sales levels are still depressed relative to pre-pandemic levels. Though this measure is in part driven by strong sales, which keeps the ratio of inventories to sales low. Still, comments from Dick's were the latest echo of a refrain heard often from the industry as retail results have poured in over the last few weeks. And that refrain says the industry is finally finding something like a ""normal"" setting after three pandemic-altered years. Back in late February, Walmart (WMT) CEO Doug McMillon said his team, ""acted quickly and aggressively to address the inventory and cost challenges we faced last year."" ""We ended the quarter with inventory about flat to last year which is better than we anticipated and even better when you consider how inflation lifts that number,"" McMillon added on a call with analysts. ""And [we] did it while improving in-stock levels."" McMillon added: ""And so as we look at where we are today with much better position around inventory...I feel like this year will be more of a normal environment for markdowns or certainly more normal than what it was last year."" The company did, however, say there was ""work to be done"" on its apparel inventory levels. But clothing retailers Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN) both indicated in their latest reports inventory levels continue to improve. ""Despite an increasingly volatile macroeconomic climate, through the ongoing execution of our Polaris strategy, we remained agile, pivoted to meet customer demand and elevated our approach to inventory management,” said Jeff Gennette, Macy's chairman and CEO. ""In the fourth quarter, we benefited from our disciplined inventory approach."" The company reported inventory levels that were down 3% from last year and said, ""Inventory productivity continues to be a focus for the company in 2023 and beyond."" Nordstrom, for its part, said inventory levels were down 15% from last year and at levels similar to those that prevailed in 2019, the last year before the pandemic. ""We took decisive actions to right-size our inventory as we entered the new year, positioning us for greater agility amidst continuing macroeconomic uncertainty,"" said CEO Erik Nordstrom.

Powell delivered the first of his two days of semi-annual testimony to Congress on Tuesday, speaking before the Senate Banking Committee ahead of Wednesday's appearance before the House Financial Services Committee. In his prepared testimony released Tuesday, Powell spoke of a sustained central bank campaign to rein in inflation. ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,"" Powell said. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes."" Answering questions from lawmakers, Powell said the full impacts of the Fed's interest rate increases haven't yet been felt in the economy. Markets have begun to price in at least two additional 0.25% rate hikes from the central bank over its next two meetings; investors began the year with optimism the Fed would stop its rate-hiking campaign as soon as February. Powell's comments Tuesday opened the door to the possibility of both a higher terminal federal funds rate, as well as a higher pace of increases. According to data from CME Group, Powell's comments spurred traders to price in a higher chance of a 0.50% hike than a 0.25% increase later this month. The Fed will kick off its next two-day policy meeting in two weeks, with a policy announcement set for the afternoon of March 22. Elsewhere in markets, WTI crude oil was under pressure, falling more than 3.7% to around $77.40 per barrel. The 10-year Treasury yield, which has been a focal point of market action over the last few weeks, was little-changed, settling near 3.98%. On the earnings side, results from Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) early this morning sent shares of the sporting goods retailer higher by 11%. The company offered full-year earnings per share guidance that came in more than $1 per share above expectations, according to Bloomberg data. Dick's expects to earn $12.90-$13.80 per share in its fiscal 2023, up from the $12.04 the company earned last year. Same-store sales in the company's fourth quarter rose 5.3% with CEO Ed Stack telling investors the company's inventory levels are in ""great shape"" to start 2023. Elsewhere in single-stock moves, shares of Snap (SNAP) gained more than 9% on Monday — and had been up as much as 4% on Tuesday before paring gains to close up just 0.5% — with Bloomberg attributing the rally to optimism over a TikTok ban in the U.S. Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"
2023-03-07,goog,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/powell-tells-congress-rates-will-likely-be-higher-than-previously-anticipated-150011657.html,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Tuesday interest rates are likely to rise more than previously expected as the central bank works to bring down inflation, which remains stubbornly above the central bank's 2% target. U.S. stocks were trading lower Tuesday as some analysts said the comments were more hawkish than expected. Near 2:20 p.m. ET, the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) was near session lows, falling 1.5%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) off 1.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) falling 1.2%. ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,"" Powell told the Senate Banking Committee in prepared remarks. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes."" ""Although inflation has been moderating in recent months, the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy,"" Powell added. The latest Consumer Price Index report released last month showed prices rose 6.4% over the prior year in January, a slowdown from last summer's peak inflation rate of 9.1% but still well above the Fed's 2% target. Powell's comments spurred traders to price in a higher chance of a 0.50% hike than a 0.25% increase later this month, according to data from CME Group. In a note, Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner said Powell’s remarks ""opened the door"" to a return of 0.50% hikes, ""If the incoming data flow warrants it."" If there are ""upside surprises"" in a jobs report this Friday from the Labor Department, that could ""drive a faster and longer tightening cycle,"" according to Zentner's note. The Fed projected at its December policy meeting interest rates would need to rise to a range of 5%-5.25% this year, though Powell's comments now suggest rates will need to eventually rise above this level. Following the Fed's February policy decision, the central bank's benchmark interest rate stands in a range of 4.5%-4.75%. Some Senate Democrats challenged Powell during Tuesday’s hearing, cautioning that his rate hikes could lead to job losses. Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown (D-OH) said there are other ways to bring down prices, citing the strengthening of supply chains, boosting of U.S. manufacturing and the rebuilding of infrastructure. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said if the central bank raises rates as much as planned, to 5%-5.25% excluding any further rate hikes Powell has now suggested above that level, unemployment would rise to 4.6%. That, she said, would cost two million people jobs. ""Chair Powell, if you could speak directly to the two million hardworking people who have decent jobs today, who you're planning to get fired over the next year, what would you say to them?"" Warren asked. Powell, in response, said: ""I would explain to people more broadly that inflation is extremely high and it's hurting the working people of this country badly. All of them, not just two million of them, but all of them are suffering under high inflation, and we are taking the only measures we have to bring inflation down."" In a hat tip to these concerns, Powell said in his prepared remarks that the Fed is ""acutely aware"" high inflation is causing ""significant hardship"" for Americans while also pledging to “stay the course until the job is done."" The Fed chair said Tuesday policymakers will continue to make decisions on a meeting by meeting basis. Powell noted that economic data from January on inflation, job growth, consumer spending, and manufacturing production have partly reversed course from the slowdown seen back in December. Powell attributed some of the softening to unseasonably warm weather in January, but cautioned that the ""breadth of the reversal"" suggests inflation is running higher than expected. He reiterated the Fed still needs to see a drop in services inflation excluding housing to bring inflation down, which is likely to require a weaker job market.

2023-03-07,goog,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/heres-what-biden-wants-to-do-to-shore-up-medicare-135302609.html,"President Biden is set to formally release his 2024 budget proposal later this week and is already offering previews on what he plans to do with Medicare. In new details released Tuesday to keep the program afloat into the 2050s, Biden says he can extend the solvency of the program without any benefit cuts via three moves: an increase on the tax rate on both earned and unearned income above $400,000; the closing of loopholes that shields some “pass-through” income from Medicare taxes; and allowing Medicare to negotiate on a wider array of prescription drugs. And overall, the president is looking at least five different tax changes for wealthy Americans and corporations to pay for his myriad ideas — both for Medicare and his larger push to “invest in America” and pay down the deficit. And while the proposal isn’t likely to get a vote on Capitol Hill, it will serve as an important marker of Biden’s priorities. The early focus on Medicare — as well as Social Security — underlines just how “deeply embedded” the twin programs have become in Biden’s political identity, Alex Lawson, the executive director of a group called Social Security Works, recently noted in an interview. The president talks nearly every week about the program and also released a New York Times op-ed on the topic Tuesday morning. Defending the programs now “seems to be one of the defining characteristics of Biden-world,” Lawson added. What the White House appears to be doing with this week’s choreographed multi-day rollout — culminating in a formal unveiling on Thursday in Philadelphia — is an attempt to shape the conversation as both the debt ceiling fight heats up this summer and a likely Biden 2024 re-election campaign kicks off. In the op-ed released Tuesday morning, President Biden wrote that “Medicare is more than a government program. It’s the rock-solid guarantee that Americans have counted on to be there for them when they retire."" The issue is top of mind with a key Medicare trust fund likely to run low on funds as early as 2028, according to a recent government trustees report. Meanwhile, Social Security likely has the funds to continue paying out current benefits for only a few years longer, through 2034. Biden’s proposal would increase the Medicare tax rate from 3.8% to 5% on all income above $400,000. It would also target what is known as net investment income - an additional fee on the returns for high-income earners as well as “pass through” business for Americans above $400,000 per year. The White House aims to change the rules and close loopholes around that income, which it notes can be shielded from the taxes that fund the Medicare program because it is classified currently as “neither earned income nor investment income.” The proposal would close loopholes in that area and also change the government's rules to allow that money to be sent to Medicare’s crucial Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, President of the American Action Forum, noted in a Yahoo Finance Live interview on Tuesday that the net investment tax piece is ""really using a tool that has never been used in Medicare before [and] it's not a particularly good piece of tax policy."" Holtz-Eakin, a Republican and former director of the Congressional Budget Office, added that the way to get these programs under control fiscally is to control growth, and ""you can't tax your way out of this."" The budget will also propose savings via new prescription drug reforms by giving Medicare the authority to negotiate prices for additional higher-cost drugs. The White House estimates these changes will save $200 billion over the coming decade. “There are ways in which the program can be operated more efficiently,” said Paul Van de Water, a Medicare specialist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who also listed other options for the years ahead like lowering payment rates to healthcare providers and limiting payments to Medicare Advantage. But even with all that, “it's still going to be essential we think to raise additional revenues,” he said. Van de Water also noted that Biden has previously proposed changes to the net investment income tax during a previous budget proposal. Thursday’s release will be Biden’s third since taking office. Tuesday’s unveiling is just the first step in what is much more detail to come about Biden's ideas and how he’ll pay for it all. In a recent online video, Biden’s budget director, Shalanda Young, outlined the overall priorities, including expanding the economy, lowering costs, protecting Social Security and Medicare as well as reducing the deficit by $2 trillion over the coming decade. So what other tax increases could be proposed? Administration officials say that both wealthy Americans and corporations will be the focus. In his State of the Union, Biden called to quadruple the excise tax on stock buybacks and to institute a new ""billionaire minimum tax"" on wealth. Both appear set for repeat appearances on Thursday. The president could also call to raise the top corporate tax rate, which would come in addition to a corporate minimum tax instituted last year as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. While House Republicans have pledged that all tax increases are off the table and won't be considered in the House. But the move will increase the pressure on Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) to release his own plan, something he has promised is coming soon. What Speaker McCarthy has discussed in the past is creating the “path” to balance the budget. House Republicans have already floated some small-scale proposals — targeting things like Medicaid and what they term as “woke waste.” What’s unclear — and Democrats and some budget experts charge is impossible — is how that plan takes a significant bite out of the deficit if Social Security, Medicare, and tax increases are all off the table. “We’re not going to sit here and be lectured by those folks about fiscal responsibility,” Biden said recently in a preview of the likely debate to come, adding of the GOP, it will “be interesting to see what they want to cut and what their numbers add up to.” This post has been updated.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. When Fed Chair Jay Powell settles in for his semi-annual testimony to the Senate Banking Committee today, investors will be looking for confirmation that the central bank is going to keep raising interest rates for the next several meetings to fight inflation. Besides the ongoing debate about whether the Fed’s actions are going to send the U.S. economy into recession and stocks into a tailspin, there’s been one other important side effect: the bond market is the hottest it’s been in years. That’s newly true not just for institutional investors, but for retail traders as well. That’s because online trading of Treasuries is accessible at a critical mass for the first time with rates at these levels. It's never been easier to buy, be it directly via the Treasury Department, from the discount brokerages, or through ETFs. The repricing of rate expectations this year has sent yields on many Treasury notes and bonds to their highest in 15 years, with the 2-year, 10-year (TNX), and 30-year all yielding around 4%. It’s been a huge shift for fixed income. Besides institutional investors salivating over government and corporate debt, retail traders are so keen they've repeatedly crashed the TreasuryDirect website, which provides a conduit to Treasuries and I bonds. (The latter is an inflation-protected instrument that has both a fixed rate and one that changes with inflation). “For pretty much the entire decade, leading up to this year, when people asked about retail and fixed income, I could just simply say, ‘no one really cares.’ The past year, that has significantly changed,” Shawn Cruz, Head Trading Strategist at TD Ameritrade, told Yahoo Finance. Sales of Treasury bills – those with maturities of one year or less – through TreasuryDirect were $12.0 billion in January, a record. Before last August, that number hadn’t cracked $5 billion. Net sales of I bonds were $4.2 billion in January, after spiking to $6.8 billion last October. Salim Ramji, Global Head of iShares and Index Investments at BlackRock, was enthusiastic about fixed income when he recently spoke to Yahoo Finance: “It’s a great time for investors to look for yield, but they don’t have to take the kind of risk that they might have two, three, four years ago, because you can get 4% yields in Treasuries. You can get 5% yields in investment grade, even at the front end.” BlackRock, as the largest provider of ETFs by assets, has benefited from the boom. Thus far in 2023, investors have poured $9.9 billion into U.S. iShares fixed income ETFs. And not all investors are going long; the firm’s most popular instrument in February in the category was the iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF (SHV). How long will the party last? Even if the Fed raises interest rates at its next three meetings, some strategists have called for a longer period of higher inflation and higher interest rates, an end to the so-called “Great Moderation.”  BlackRock predicts that fixed income ETF assets under management will reach $5 trillion by 2030. As Ramji said, “Having rates as low as they were for as long as they were was kind of the aberration. I think we’re resetting back now to a much more normal fixed income environment, and the great thing for investors, as a result, is they can use it to generate income, and so for retirees or people looking at their wealth portfolios, they’re able to generate good, long-term income from long-term investments like Treasuries or investment grade.” In other words, for a lot of retail investors right now, boring is beautiful. - Economy Wholesale Inventories, January Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before Senate Banking Committee Earnings Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS); Casey's General (CASY); CrowdStrike (CRWD); Manchester United (MANU); Sea Limited (SE); Stitch Fix (SFIX); Thor Industries (THO) Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"
2023-03-06,goog,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-march-6-2023-123642397.html,"U.S. stocks lost steam Monday afternoon after rallying earlier in the session, kicking off a busy week on Wall Street with a mixed tone. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended the session near the flatline, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) increased 0.1%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) edged down 0.1%, reversing its gains from earlier in the trading session. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note hovered near 4% Monday afternoon, before settling at 3.98%. Crude oil traded higher, with U.S. benchmark WTI up at $80.55 a barrel. The dollar index moved lower trading at $104.34. U.S. stocks gained on Friday to close out a volatile week, while bond yields pulled back from their recent highs. The three major indexes rose for the week, with the Dow Jones adding 1.7%, the S&P 500 closing 1.9% higher, and the Nasdaq gaining 2.6%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury settled back below the key 4% level, and the two-year yield fell to 4.86%. Economic data released on Friday showed the services sector grew in February. This week, Wall Street will be paying close attention to the monthly jobs report out Friday. The February jobs report is expected to show 215,000 new jobs have been added to the economy, according to economist estimates, a slower pace from January’s blowout number of 517,000 job additions. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.4%. Another key point from the report will be wage growth, with a 0.3% month-to-month bump in average hourly earnings anticipated and 4.7% over the last year. Economists at Bank of America, led by Michael Gapen, believe a deceleration from January will be tied largely to weather shifts and a general mean-reverting nature of payrolls. ""Typically, when payroll growth records a sizable increase or decrease, we see a reversal in the following month,"" the firm noted. Also, investors will be keeping an eye on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's two-day biannual monetary policy testimony on Capitol Hill, which begins Tuesday. Other highlights this week include ADP’s monthly read on private payroll growth, January’s report on job openings from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Fed’s Beige Book. In single stock moves, Apple (AAPL) shares gained nearly 2% on Monday as Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng initiated coverage of Apple with a buy rating and a price target of $199. Ng noted Apple's success in hardware design and brand loyalty has led to a growing installed base of users that provide visibility into revenue growth. And Apple's valuation is attractive relative to its historical multiple and to peers. Ciena (CIEN) shares jumped 4% Monday after the company posted better than expected results that topped analysts expectations amid strong demand in its networking platforms business. Shares of BridgeBio Pharma (BBIO) surged more than 50% after the company topped Wall Street's expectations in a study of children with achondroplasia, a genetic condition that slows bone growth. Snap (SNAP) shares climbed 9% amid growing chatter that the U.S. could restrict — or ban — use of the TikTok app. Spirit Airlines (SAVE) shares tanked nearly 9% following reports that JetBlue Airways (JBLU) is bracing for turbulence from the Justice Department as it tries to block the airline's planned takeover of Spirit Airlines in the coming days, The Wall Street Journal reported. JetBlue shares finished up about 1%. On the earnings front, Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Oracle (ORCL) and BJ's Wholesale (BJ) are set to report results this week. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-06,goog,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/as-airbnb-wins-back-wall-street-some-hosts-see-saturation-130755035.html,"Airbnb (ABNB) dazzled Wall Street with better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings results and forward guidance on February 14. ""We believe ADR [average daily rate] was the key upside surprise relative to investor expectations,"" Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni wrote about the company's Q1 guidance in a research note, ""which should help support more optimism around further upside on pricing and margin in the remaining three quarters [of 2023]."" Investors cheered the company's quarter by sending shares up 13% on February 15, the stock's biggest one-day increase since Airbnb's December 2020 IPO. On February 16, the stock logged its highest close since May 2022. Even after giving back some post-earnings gains, Airbnb stock is up about 45% from a record low reached at the end of 2022. But the sentiment shift came as something of a surprise to hosts and managers using the home-booking platform who say they are finding it harder and harder to book guests. Ric Kenworthy, who manages 96 short-rental property listings through a company, Old Town Rental, in Arizona, was scrambling to fill unbooked units ahead of last month's Super Bowl in Glendale. ""We ended up at, let's just assume midday Saturday before the Super Bowl, close to 90% booked for all of our properties,"" Kenworthy told Yahoo Finance, later adding: ""Some key markets are experiencing quite a bit of saturation."" Kenworthy said he ended up cutting his listing prices by 50%: The going-rate for one of his rental properties went for $450-$600 a night that weekend after he'd been anticipating a rate closer to $1,000 a night given the demand generally created by an event like the Super Bowl. ""In 2022, we saw new heights in demand on the Airbnb platform and the result is continued growth in typical Host income, which was over $14,000 in the US,"" Sam Randall, a representative for Airbnb, told Yahoo Finance in a statement. ""We continue to invest in the success of our Host community and in the coming months will release new pricing tools to help them set competitive prices."" While some Airbnb hosts may not be feeling the full benefits, there is little doubt travel demand is back in full swing. Despite sticky inflation, consumers are booking trips: Data from a Bank of America Institute survey shows money spent on airline travel per household jumped 3.5% in January while international spending also increased compared to two years ago. ""I think the psychological impact of being locked down for some portion of the pandemic has only accelerated the trend that had already started,"" Marriott International (MAR) CEO Anthony Capuano told Yahoo Finance Live after the company's fourth-quarter earnings results showed the average room rates up 13% and revenue earned per average room jumping 29% year over year. Airbnb posted revenue of $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter, better than analyst expectations for revenues of $1.86 billion. The company's earnings per share also topped estimates, coming in at $0.48 cents against $0.08 forecasted. On the company's earnings call, CEO Brian Chesky told analysts Airbnb experienced ""tremendous growth"" in units listed online, ending 2022 with 6.6 million active listings. That was 16% higher compared to the previous year. Chesky attributed the increase in supply to two factors: demand and systematic improvements to their platform. As people flocked back to traveling, nights and experiences booked increased 20% in the fourth quarter, with active bookers in the fourth quarter reaching a record for the company. ""[Annual] revenue of $8.4 billion grew 40% year-over-year,"" Chesky said on the earnings call. ""And when you exclude foreign exchange, our revenue increased by 46% year-over-year."" The average daily rate for an Airbnb accommodation grew 36% compared to 2019 levels, according to CFO David Stephenson. He noted that it's generally ""more expensive"" to stay at an Airbnb than other accommodations and projected rates would come down ""modestly"" through the end of this year. ""We're not seeing any major shifts in overall kind of utilization rate that give us any concern,"" Stephenson said. ""We feel like we continue to keep, in aggregate, this nice balance of growing supply and growing demand, and we want to keep that relative balance."" Airbnb also stressed that the company is focused on three strategic priorities: raising awareness of hosting, upgrading core services, and scaling services beyond its core offerings. In late 2022, Airbnb added short-term sublet listings in an effort to grow its footprint among the multifamily market. The company asserted landlords and property managers using the sublet service could earn about 20% of the booking revenue. Airbnb also rolled out new categories, including one called ""OMG,"" which captures the most unique and exclusive accommodations. And after a Wall Street Journal report highlighted how some travelers were frustrated with host-mandated chore lists and the app's pricing format leading to sneaky costs, Airbnb launched a feature to show users price totals that include cleaning, service, and other fees. Looking ahead, some wonder about the sustainability of Airbnb's boom. “Can the top line demand persist? And then given their growth and supply, can the average rates [hold]?,” Nick Jones, research analyst at JMP Securities, told Yahoo Finance. ""If the demand wanes, that's going to increase available supply at any given day, which then... should result in lower prices, which then would impact their profitability."" Even if demand plateaus, the situation could change: January data from AirDNA suggested that rapid listing growth ""outpaced rising demand"" in 2022. ""U.S. short-term rentals earned over $62 billion ($141 billion globally) throughout the year (up 25.1% YoY), with almost 200 million nights stayed and over two million listings receiving at least one booking,"" AirDNA stated. ""Overall occupancy ended the year at 58.7%, a significant drop from the 61.3% in 2021."" In any case, as travel evolves after the pandemic bust and boom, some Airbnb hosts see a shift in consumer behavior. Michelle Burson, owner of a 4,000 square-foot Airbnb in Brookings, Oregon, is experiencing less foot traffic for her rental unit. ""Our bookings [have] declined last year compared to the previous year,"" Burson said. In Burson's view, ""one of the reasons was people were taking their traditional vacations…going to Hawaii, Europe, rather than driving, [or taking] road trips."" And Masha Löfstedt, who owns three rental properties in Oregon, struggled to get her property booked ahead of the holiday season. ""One of our houses that rents out all the time, nobody's booked for this weekend. That's like the first time in years,"" Löfstedt told Yahoo Finance in late 2022.

While I really enjoyed watching Salesforce and C3.ai shares explode higher post earnings last week, hot movers along these lines have been too few and far between (in either direction) in recent weeks. But if you take a step back and level set the stock market today, the muted action kind of makes a great deal of sense. Investors are facing a fresh dilemma — call it paralysis by analysis amid all the incoming data flying in. On the one hand, we have hot retail sales and inflation reports from the government — both calling into question whether the Federal Reserve is moving fast enough to squash inflation. On the other end of the spectrum, the jobs market continues to be solid (as probably seen in this week's jobs report). Yet, when you look at fourth quarter earnings (and conference calls) from Best Buy, Home Depot, Target and other retailers, you will see consumer weakness in big ticket merchandise. Dig into Target's earnings, and you will see a shopper trading down to cheaper private label goods because they are less inflationary and they just got laid off by a tech company. Taken together, this is a confusing time to be an investor – something market maven Keith Lerner at Truist captures in a new note he sent me: ""The recent action is very much aligned with a key market dilemma we have been highlighting: If the economy stays stronger, as we have seen recently, Fed policy is set to remain tighter, and this will weigh on market valuations. Or, instead, if the economy weakens, this will pressure profits. Neither of these outcomes are favorable for premium market valuations."" In other words, Mr. Market doesn't know what he wants! And if you think all the bad news of any kind is priced into stocks, Lerner adds these considerations: ""For perspective, the S&P 500’s forward P/E of 17.6x is still slightly above the 10-year average of 17.2x, and that’s in the context of a high degree of uncertainty around economic growth, inflation, and earnings. Forward earnings estimates are hovering near a 52- week low, and downside risks remain. The 1-year U.S. Treasury yield has jumped above 5% for the first time since 2007, and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which is hovering around 4%, is nearly double the average of the past decade.""

2023-03-04,goog,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/bankman-fried-flip-phone-limited-153437236.html,"By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sam Bankman-Fried should be allowed while on bail to have a flip phone with no internet capability and a basic laptop with limited functions, but be forbidden from using other electronic communication devices, the U.S. Department of Justice said. The proposal to limit the indicted FTX cryptocurrency exchange founder's communications was filed late on Friday in Manhattan federal court, on behalf of the government and Bankman-Fried's defense team. It requires approval by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who oversees the case. Kaplan had signaled at a Feb. 16 hearing that he might jail the 30-year-old Bankman-Fried for testing the limits of his $250 million bail package by communicating in ways that could not be monitored. The judge said he did not want to set Bankman-Fried ""loose in this garden of electronic devices,"" following accusations that Bankman-Fried tried to contact possible government witnesses and used a virtual private network to watch football. Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty after prosecutors said he stole billions of dollars of FTX customer funds to plug losses at his Alameda Research hedge fund. He faces 12 criminal charges under an indictment made public on Feb. 23. The proposed flip phone or other non-smartphone for Bankman-Fried would be limited to voice calls and SMS text messages. Laptop internet use would be restricted to specified virtual private networks, 23 websites for personal use including news, sports and food delivery, and websites to help Bankman-Fried prepare for his scheduled Oct. 2 trial. Bankman-Fried is living under house arrest with his parents, both Stanford Law School professors, in Palo Alto, California. The parents agreed to submit sworn affidavits that they would not bring other electronic devices into their home or let their son use theirs.

2023-03-03,goog,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-march-3-2023-133941006.html,"U.S. stocks rallied on Friday, rounding out a big end to the week, while bond yields retreated slightly from their recent march. At the close, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) surged 1.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) increased 1.1%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 2%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note (^TNX) moved back and forth around the key 4% level Friday, eventually settling below the line, after services data showed economic activity expanded in February. Crude oil traded higher, with U.S. benchmark WTI (CL=F) up at $79.71 a barrel. On the economic data side, economic activity in the services sector grew in February for the second consecutive month as the ISM Services PMI came in at 55.1, slightly lower from 55.2 recorded in January and above economist expectations of 54.5. February's ISM Services figures ""suggests activity continues to expand at a reasonably healthy pace, but provides further reason to doubt the idea that there has been a resurgence in growth since the start of the year,"" Andrew Hunter, deputy chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note following the release. The moves come after the Federal Reserve published a semiannual Monetary Policy Report to Congress that details the central bank's plans to hike interest rates as a means to restore price stability. Officials indicated ""that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2% over time,"" the Fed said in its report. Stocks rallied on Thursday, with the S&P 500 trading lower for most of the session before rallying after commentary from Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic. Bostic said he’s still open to raising rates by another quarter percentage point at the central bank’s March meeting. “I let the data guide me,” Bostic told reporters in a press briefing. “If the data continue to come in suggesting the economy is stronger than I had projected, I’ll adjust my policy trajectory.” Bostic, who isn’t a voter on monetary policy this year, wrote an essay on Wednesday calling for the Fed to raise its policy rate by 50 basis points to a range of 5%-5.25% and then keep it there until well into 2024. Fed officials raised the benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point in February, pulling the target to stand in a range of 4.5%-4.75%. Policymakers will be releasing new projections after the central bank’s March 21-22 meeting. In single stock moves, C3.ai (AI) shares surged over 30% Friday after the company posted fiscal third quarter revenue that came at $66.7 million, beating analyst expectations of $64.2 million. Shares of Rivian (RIVN) jumped after the EV maker said on Friday it's keeping to the original production forecast of 50,000 vehicles in 2023. Costco (COST) shares sank 2% after the bulk retailer posted mixed results for the second quarter. Total revenue for its latest quarter was $55.27 billion, slightly below analysts' expectations of $55.58 billion. During the earnings call, the company provided some hopeful news on the inflation front. ChargePoint (CHPT) shares were down Friday after the maker of EV charging stations reported disappointing results and issued softer guidance. Shares of Amazon (AMZN) were up 3% as the company pauses construction on its second quarters in Arlington, Virginia. The move follows the tech giant's announcements of job cuts in the wake of slowing consumer and corporate spending. Marvell Technology (MRVL) stock fell after the company reported mixed results, with earnings in line with expectations but guidance weaker than forecasted. Shares of Meta Platforms (META) surged 6% as the company announced it would slash prices of its Quest Pro virtual-reality headset after the product launch. In the cryptocurrency market, both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) fell as customers pull their funds from crypto bank Silvergate (SI), whose stock plunged more than 57% during the trading session on Thursday. Following the drop in Bitcoin, the pullback is close to 10% and the digital asset was on pace to close below its 50-day moving average for the first time in almost two months, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-02,goog,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-today-march-2-2023-135533324.html,"Stocks rallied on Thursday with the Dow leading markets higher as results from Salesforce (CRM) lifted the index, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq shook off early losses to finish in the green. At the close on Thursday, the S&P 500 was up 0.76%, the Nasdaq higher by 0.73%, and the blue chip Dow up 1.05%. Rates remained a key focus for investors, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note settling north of 4%, its highest level since November. The rise in yields has come as investors brace for more aggressive action from the Federal Reserve in the coming months as inflation stays elevated and the economy remains strong. On the front end of the Treasury curve, the yield on 2-year notes continued to trade near its highest level since 2007. The 2-year yield, which stood near 4.8% on Thursday, is seen as the best proxy for investor expectations of the Fed's near-term path for interest rates. In single-stock moves, shares of Salesforce rose 11.5% on Thursday as investors cheered the company's latest quarterly report, which saw the embattled Dow member double down on cost-cutting initiatives and shareholder return plans. The stock's opening gap higher of 16% was its largest since Aug. 2020, according to data from Bloomberg. In an interview with Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi late Wednesday, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in reference to the company's efficiency initiatives: ""We have hit the hyper-space button."" The company announced in its quarterly report an increase in its share repurchase authorization to $20 billion, with COO Brian Millham telling investors on a call, ""We're inspecting every part of our business to find opportunities to drive efficiencies and reduce cost of sales, marketing, and G&A."" Salesforce's 11.5% jump, good for jsut over a $19 per share increase in the stock price, added roughly 110 points to the price-weighted Dow's 340 point gain on Thursday. Elsewhere in single-stock moves, shares of troubled bank Silvergate (SI) fell 57% on Thursday after the company delayed the filing of its annual report and said it would likely report losses larger than those previously disclosed. The bank took on several high-profile crypto clients in recent years and has seen its share price collapse by more than 90% in the wake of the failure of FTX, among other crypto bankruptcies. Tesla (TSLA) shares were also in focus on Thursday, falling 5.9% as the electric carmaker held its latest investor day on Wednesday, which revealed few new product details but emphasized the company's push to unlock new efficiencies in its manufacturing and design processes. On the economic data side, the weekly report on initial jobless claims showed 190,000 new filings for unemployment insurance were made last week, the latest sign the labor market remains robust. Though tomorrow marks the first Friday of the month, the February jobs report will not be released until March 10.

2023-03-02,goog,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/mortgage-rates-surge-closer-to-7-170022384.html,"Mortgage rates jumped higher this week, getting even closer to 7% and crushing homebuyer activity, which hit a 28-year low. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage increased to 6.65% from 6.50% the week prior, according to Freddie Mac. Rates have climbed over a half-point in February, reversing declines since mid-November. The spike in rates is another blow to would-be buyers, who are also facing still-high home prices and a shortage of affordable homes for sale. Sellers also appear to be pulling their listings, rather than cutting prices further to spur interest. “I think the biggest concern is buying into a market that would continue to go down,” Jeff Reynolds, broker at Compass and founder of UrbanCondoSpaces, recently told Yahoo Finance. “In my 18-year career, I have never seen rate moves like we are seeing now.” The volume of applications to purchase a home slid by 6% from one week earlier, the Mortgage Bankers Association’s survey of applications for the week ending Feb. 24 found. Overall, demand was 44% lower than the same week a year ago and has nosedived to a 28-year low. The drop in demand registered this past month is a sign that affordability remains a top concern, according to Redfin Deputy Chief Economist Taylor Marr. “The housing market took two steps forward in December and January, but has taken one step back in February,” Marr said in a statement. “Mortgage rates crept back this month, which is prompting more buyers and sellers to back off.” Another reason for the pullback in demand is rising home prices. The national median list price increased to $415,000 in February, Realtor.com data showed, up from $406,000 in January. While that’s down 7.6% from June’s peak of $449,000 – it still represents a yearly growth rate of 7.8%. That translates to out-of-pocket costs for buyers. According to Realtor.com, the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home is roughly $630 higher than a year ago. That puts the monthly mortgage payment 45.1% higher than a year ago, exceeding rent growth, up 2.9% from a year ago, and inflation, up 6.4%. As rates continue to climb, fewer home sellers are active this year. The number of newly-listed homes for sale declined by 15.9% in February compared with the previous year, Realtor.com data found. That’s a larger rate of decline versus January’s 10.4% decrease, but a small improvement from November and December. Overall, new listings remained 27% below pre-pandemic 2017 to 2019 levels. According to Redfin, existing homeowners don’t want to move because they don’t want to give up their ultra-low mortgage rates. As of February, approximately 85% of mortgage holders have a rate far below 6%. Homeowners may also be hesitant to put their homes on the market due to soft homebuyer demand that’s forcing sellers to cut prices. “We'll find out in the next 30 days if buyers are getting used to higher rates,” Reynolds said, “or if they will stay on the sideline waiting for rates to come back to earth.” Gabriella is a personal finance reporter at Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-02,goog,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/what-the-end-of-the-great-moderation-era-means-for-investors-morning-brief-103057491.html,"This article first appeared in the Morning Brief.

Subscribe Thursday, March 2, 2023 Today's newsletter is by Jared Blikre, a reporter focused on the markets on Yahoo Finance. Follow him on Twitter @SPYJared. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. In 2004, then-Fed chair Ben Bernanke gave a speech titled, ""The Great Moderation."" His thesis: ""One of the most striking features of the economic landscape over the past twenty years or so has been a substantial decline in macroeconomic volatility."" And while the Global Financial Crisis dented this belief, a post-crisis economic recovery and stock market boom brought these ideas back into vogue among many investors who rode a ""stocks only go up"" rally for more than a decade. But with inflation at multi-decade highs and interest rates at their highest levels in over 15 years, some investors are saying that the old investing epoch has come to an end — ushering in a new era where fundamentals matter, traditional savers are rewarded once again, and the volatility that Bernanke said goodbye to is back. In other words, choppier waters might be the new norm for a while. There are a few things that are starkly different about this present business cycle, Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, told Yahoo Finance Live Wednesday. First, there's the hot labor market, despite the white-collar layoffs. Historically, it's the lower-wage workers that are first in line to get cut. ""Yet another thing about this cycle that is just so different relative to past cycles,"" Saunders said. To date, this downturn has been felt mostly at the upper ends of the wealth spectrum, with asset prices like stocks, bonds, and real estate suffering declines. Meanwhile, inflation is a pernicious problem that disproportionately affects lower incomes. But it has not yet become entrenched — at least in the eyes of policy makers. Investors may not know what to think, but Sonders expects the current fog to lift a bit when we get the next batch of quarterly reports in April. But it might not be a clarity worth celebrating. Analysts have already been lowering the bar for the first quarter earnings, and Sonders believes they have a ways to go considering the bond market is signaling the Fed needs to be yet more aggressive. ""One of the factors most highly correlated to corporate earnings is the 10-year [U.S. Treasury] yield, with a lag,"" she says. Sonders believes the 10-year yield is forecasting the Fed will need to keep rates higher for longer, and that ""the path of least resistance for [earnings estimates] is down"" — targeting the first half of this year. Whether or not that near-term pain materializes, Sonders closes the door on the prior epoch of declining rates and volatility, then describes what investors can expect in the years to come. ""I think that the end of the Great Moderation era is very much here ... Gone are the days of cheap access to goods, cheap access to energy, [and] cheap access to labor. I think all three of those ships have sailed,"" she says. Sonders argues that reversing the engine of globalization and reorienting toward regionalism will have profound investing implications over the secular time frame. ""I would therefore expect greater inflation volatility, economic volatility, [and] geopolitical volatility. We're in this era of regionalization and demographic shifts that are pretty painful."" But as painful as these changes are for workers, consumers and investors alike, there are opportunities for investors. Consider that the Fed has finally raised short-term rates — the so-called risk-free rate — to levels that prevailed in decades prior. ""With the return of the risk-free [Treasury] rate, it's brought secular changes, including the fact that fundamentals are reattaching to prices,"" says Sonders. She goes on to explain that the market is no longer skewed so heavily toward mega cap stocks, and that there's hope for stock pickers once again after over a decade of underperformance. ""This has important implications and helps explain why equal-weighted [stock indices] have generally been doing better than [market] cap-weighted [indices] — why active [investing] has been doing better than passive [investing] — or at least is on a more level playing field with passive. And I think those are secular and as important backdrops for investors to think about.""

2023-03-02,goog,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/silvergate-stock-crashes-after-company-delays-annual-report-reveals-new-losses-121923800.html,"Shares of troubled lender Silvergate (SI) fell 57% on Thursday after the company said late Wednesday it will miss a March 16 deadline to file its already-delayed annual report. The bank said its team ""requires additional time to perform analysis, record journal entries related to subsequent events and to complete management’s evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting."" ""The Company is currently analyzing certain regulatory and other inquiries and investigations that are pending with respect to the Company,"" the company added. Silvergate shares have collapsed over the last year as the company's entanglements with several crypto firms — including bankrupt exchange FTX, among others — resulted in deposits falling by more than two-thirds in the fourth quarter of last year. In January, the company laid off 40% of its staff. The company later suspended a dividend paid on preferred shares as it sought to shore up cash. Over the last year, shares of the bank have lost more than 95%. A spokesperson for Silvergate told Yahoo Finance: ""Silvergate is working diligently to file its 10-K as soon as possible and has no further comment at this time."" In Wednesday's notice, the bank said it sold additional debt securities beyond what was previously anticipated in January and February and it expects to record further losses than what was previously disclosed. In January, the company disclosed it took $887 million worth of non-interest losses in the fourth quarter. The sales are primarily to repay ""outstanding advances"" it received from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, Silvergate said. The bank also needs additional time to complete an ""evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting"" being conducted by its third party accounting firm. Citing business and regulatory challenges, the company is weighing how much the changes might affect its ""ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements,"" according to the filing. In late January, a bi-partisan group of U.S. Senators pressed the company to provide answers over whether it was aware its clients FTX misused customer funds. A Reuters report in February said a Silvergate account controlled by Binance.US moved millions of dollars to a company controlled by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. Last week in a joint statement with the Federal Deposit and Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve made a point to highlight the heightened liquidity risks for banks taking on crypto-related clients. As for its own risks, Silvergate cited “heightened regulatory scrutiny of banking institutions that provide products and services to the digital asset industry,"" private litigation, and investigations from congressional inquiries, banking regulators and the Justice Department. Analysts at JPMorgan downgraded the stock to Underweight from Neutral and withdrew their its price target in a note out Thursday, calling the situation ""highly unusual"" and adding: ""The 'run' experienced at Silvergate appears to have been driven by a combination of (1) trust in the overall system being shaken given the collapse of previously trusted players (such as FTX) and (2) short-sellers voicing concerns (primarily on Twitter).""

2023-03-01,goog,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-march-1-2023-124448484.html,"U.S. stocks finished mostly lower Wednesday to start March as key manufacturing data offered mixed results and two Federal Reserve officials suggested a more aggressive rate-hiking campaign in the coming months. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) declined by 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was flat. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell by 0.6%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note moved upward and briefly touched 4% Wednesday. Crude oil traded higher, with U.S. benchmark WTI up at $77.73 a barrel. On the economic data side, U.S. manufacturing firms signaled a grim outlook for the sector, according to the latest PMI data from S&P Global. The seasonally adjusted S&P Global US Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index was revised lower to 47.3 in February, up from 46.9 in January. The reading indicates ""a solid deterioration in the health of the goods-producing sector, despite the pace of decline softening to the slowest for three months."" Separately, economic activity in the manufacturing sector diminished in February for the fourth consecutive month following a 28-month period of growth, according to the Institute for Supply Management report on business. The data offered a mixed bag. Employment in manufacturing decreased to 49.10 in February from 50.60 in January. New orders rose to 47.0 compared to January's figure of 42.5. Prices paid jumped to 51.3 from January's reading of 44.5. Stocks fell Tuesday, rounding out the last day of a volatile month of February on Wall Street. According to JP Morgan’s trading desk, February’s month-end rebalance drove some weakness in equities and strength in bonds Tuesday afternoon. With February in the rearview, the S&P 500 remains up more than 3% this year, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group. Mega-caps have been a massive driver of the index moves. That said, 20 of the largest stocks in the S&P 500 have accounted for most of the index’s gains. Now, as the calendar turns, March historically sees the S&P 500’s gains in the second half of the month, Bespoke Investment Group noted. The path of the Federal Reserve's rate hikes remains in focus for investors. Two Federal Reserve officials spoke on Wednesday leaned in the move that aggressive interest rate hikes are the path forward to ease inflation. They followed Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, who said on Tuesday it would be a “danger and a mistake for policy makers to rely too heavily on market reactions” and emphasized the importance to “supplement these traditional data with observations on the ground from the real economy.” However, Goolsbee, who will be a voter at this year’s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting, didn’t comment on monetary policy. Since last year, the Fed has sharply raised rates in an effort to cool inflation. But inflation remains sticky. Policymakers will be releasing new projections after the central bank’s March 21-22 meeting. On the housing front, mortgage rates continue to move upward, pushing buyers to the sidelines as the spring housing market is underway. Both purchase and refinance applications slumped last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index. Volume of purchase applications hit a 28-year low, down 44% from a year ago. Here are some of the tickers trending on Yahoo Finance today:  Eli Lilly and Company (LLY): The drugmaker announced Wednesday morning it expects to cap out-of-pocket cost of its insulin at $35 a month. The plan comes as a promise to provide critical relief to some people with diabetes, who at times face higher medical costs.

Nio (NIO): Another EV maker gave weak revenue guidance. The Chinese premium EV startup, reported a much worse-than-expected fourth-quarter loss as margins took a hit due to in part to ""losses on purchase commitments."" Novavax (NVAX): The vaccine maker warned of its ability to stay in business through next year. This comes as the company has struggled to develop and enter the COVID-19 vaccine market. Alibaba (BABA): The stock climbed in the wake of the group’s quarterly earnings, and fueled by the 4% surge in the Hang Seng index overnight. Dollar Tree (DLTR): The discount retailer stock rose nearly 2% after the company posted weaker guidance for the current fiscal year. Tesla (TSLA): The EV maker is set to kickoff its first Investor Day event on Wednesday from its gigafactory in Austin, Texas. CEO Elon Musk is expected to announce new Tesla products that aim to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and lead to a ""fully sustainable energy future.""

2023-03-01,goog,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/goldman-sachs-tries-to-reset-firm-culture-after-three-unusual-years-171038235.html,"Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon addressed negative headlines surrounding the bank's culture during the company's second-ever investor day on Tuesday. ""I hate the noise,"" Solomon said bluntly. ""I live in the same neighborhood as you all live in and I wish the noise was different."" Various media reports of mass partner exits, coupled with recent Wall Street chatter the bank has lost its way after the failure of its consumer banking project Marcus, have all contributed to unfavorable sentiment. And this coming after the company laid off some 3,200 workers positions, or a little over 6% of its headcount, in January after a challenging 2022. Solomon admitted mistakes were made, telling investors: ""I think we’ve accomplished a lot over the past few years. We got some things right, got some things wrong."" ""I read things in the paper that don’t match what’s happening inside the firm,"" Solomon continued, explaining there were fewer partner transitions in 2022 than any other year going back to 2014. ""The culture of Goldman Sachs is incredibly strong. ...We have an extraordinary group of people working incredibly hard,"" he said. ""We also recognize we've gone through a very unusual period over last 3 years — the pandemic was a very tough thing on a culture like ours."" Goldman Sachs shares, down about 5% over the past month, are trading relatively flat year-to-date — underperforming the S&P 500's 3% gain over that same time period. Solomon went on to note Goldman is a ""human business,"" explaining the firm has made conscious decisions to invest in its culture with leadership spending more time with partners throughout the year to help push a greater sense of community throughout the organization. ""We’re going to continue to invest in our culture. I think it's very good, [but] I do think we've had dramatic shifts,"" he said, once again referencing the pandemic which was quickly followed by an unfavorable macro environment. ""That created more noise, more grumbling than usual."" Overall, ""I feel good about the partnerships [and] the culture, but that doesn't mean we don't have to keep investing,"" he reiterated. Goldman saw a rough end to 2022 with profits down a whopping 69% in Q4 amid a serious decline in deal-making revenues, pressured by a weakening economic backdrop. Following Tuesday's presentation, analyst reaction appeared cautiously optimistic, although questions remain over the path to profitability for its consumer banking unit, otherwise known as platform solutions. Shares of Goldman fell about 4% on Tuesday as the company made its pitch to investors. ""Coming out of the conference, the buzz among investors was whether GS will grow the consumer businesses or sell parts of them. Our interpretation of management's commentary is that both options are on the table,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck wrote in a new note published on Wednesday. Graseck maintained her Equal Weight rating and reiterated a 12-month price target of $332 a share. Graseck added all three business segments, which also includes investment banking and trading along with wealth and asset management, ""have an opportunity to contribute to Y/Y EPS growth as GS targets growth opportunities and gets more efficient."" Goldman reported a net loss of $660 million in its platform solutions unit in the fourth quarter with a full-year net loss settling at $1.67 billion. The company blamed the decline on higher provisions for credit losses, but stressed on Tuesday: ""Profitability is not a strategy. It is a priority and the outcome of a strategy well executed."" Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala told clients Wednesday Goldman's profitability push seemed genuine, writing: ""While investors looking for instant gratification may have been disappointed, we believe that management is on the same page with shareholders in that it appreciates the need to further shrink its consumer exposure ""unlock value"" (specifically, card partnerships and point-of-sale lending)."" Poonawala maintained a Buy rating and reiterated a $384 price target on the stock. Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-01,goog,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/feds-bostic-kashkari-call-for-higher-rates-after-concerning-inflation-jobs-data-150224928.html,"Two Federal Reserve officials speaking Wednesday said more aggressive interest rate hikes are likely necessary to slow inflation, as is the central bank keeping rates at elevated levels for some time. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said Wednesday he is remaining ""open-minded"" about whether the Fed should raise rates by 25 or 50 basis points at its next policy meeting on March 21-22. Markets currently expect a 25 basis point, or 0.25%, rate increase from the central bank. ""I’m open-minded about whether it's 25 or 50 basis points [at the next meeting],"" Kashkari said during a Q&A at a Sioux Falls Business CEO event. ""What's more important is what we signal in the dot plot."" The Fed will release a new set of economic forecasts and interest rate expectations alongside its March 22 policy statement. Kashkari said in December, he jotted down raising interest rates up to 5.4% and holding rates at that level for an extended period. ""At this point I haven't decided what my dot is, but I would lean towards continuing to raise further that I would continue to push up my policy path."" ""Given the data in the last month — higher inflation than we expected and a strong jobs report — these are concerning data points suggesting we're not making progress as quickly as we'd like,"" Kashkari said. ""At the same time shouldn't overreact to one month of data even if the data is troubling."" Kashkari is a voting member of the FOMC, the Fed committee that sets monetary policy, in 2023. Elsewhere, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said Wednesday he believes the Fed needs to raise its policy rate by 50 basis points, to a range of 5%-5.25%, and hold it at that level until well into 2024. ""We must determine when inflation is irrevocably moving lower,"" Bostic wrote in an essay published Wednesday. ""We're not there yet. That's why I think we need to raise the federal funds rate to between 5-5.25% and leave it there well into 2024. This will allow tighter policy to filter through the economy and ultimately bring aggregate supply and aggregate demand into better balance and thus lower inflation."" Bostic is not a voting member of the FOMC in 2023, but will be a voting member in 2024. Bostic said in order to consider reversing the course of monetary policy, he needs to see a better balance in the job market between labor supply and demand and see broad-based inflation narrow. Bostic noted about half of the goods in the CPI market basket still show inflation rates of 6% or higher. The Fed targets inflation that averages 2%. ""If we are going to get inflation back in the range of our target, the breadth of inflation will have to narrow considerably,"" Bostic wrote. ""When inflation is no longer top of mind, our mission will largely be accomplished. We are clearly not there yet. But I—and the Committee—are committed to doing all we can to ensure that we get there as soon as possible."" Both Bostic and Kashkari noted that while the increase in interest rates has slowed the housing and real estate sectors, they aren’t seeing many signs higher rates are really slowing down the rest of the economy. ""Business contacts tell us activity may well soften, but they don't anticipate a severe deterioration,"" Bostic wrote. ""When businesses think customers will buy less of their product or service in the near and medium term, then they will adjust hiring and investment plans accordingly."" Kashkari said the U.S is not in recession right now pointing to strong job growth, but said whether the Fed can avoid causing a recession with its interest rate hikes to fight inflation — a so-called soft-landing —remains an open question. ""The track record is not good at being able to slow down the economy this much without going a little too far and heading into recession,"" he said. ""[But] typically, when the central bank has caused a recession by raising interest rates, the bounce back can be very fast."" Kashkari said the dynamics in this economic cycle are different given families and states have strong balance sheets and supply chains are getting better. Both Fed officials said the cost of raising rates too much outweighs the costs of raising rates too little, adding the Fed must avoid a 1970s scenario in which the central bank cut rates too soon, causing inflation to re-surge and forcing the Volcker-led Fed to hike rates much higher to ultimately bring down inflation.

Follow him on Twitter @MylesUdland and on LinkedIn. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. U.S. consumers and the executives that Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon talks to have a lot in common — they feel good about today and worse about tomorrow. New data out from The Conference Board on Tuesday showed consumer confidence dipped in February, with the decline entirely driven by expectations. The Conference Board's index fell to 102.9 in February from 106 in January and 109 in December; December's reading was the highest since Sept. 2021. Underneath the surface of this decline, however, was another month where a strong labor market lifted consumers' current expectations while fears about the future loomed. ""The present situation index rose for a third straight month, underpinned by upbeat views on employment and business conditions,"" wrote Gurleen Chadha, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, in a note to clients on Tuesday. ""That index rose 1.7pts to 152.8. The differential between jobs 'plentiful' and jobs 'hard to get' rose to 41.5ppts, the highest since April 2022, indicating that current labor market conditions are still quite tight."" In January, the U.S. economy added a surprising 517,000 jobs while the unemployment rate stood at 3.4%. Meanwhile, speaking at Goldman's second-ever investor day on Tuesday, Solomon said the executives he spends his days speaking with are feeling better about a ""soft landing"" for the economy, but that inflation worries are ""hampering confidence."" ""When I talk to CEOs, they feel more uncertain about the course of inflation as we run through 2023, 2024. ...There's a real belief that inflation will be stickier and harder to moderate than markets now predict,"" Solomon said. The Conference Board's data shows consumers remain pleasantly surprised the soft labor market they'd braced for hasn't materialized just as executives fretting over recession remain similarly relieved. And yet both groups in their own way remain braced for some version of economic impact. It's just not clear that hasn't already happened. We're coming off a year in which the S&P 500 fell 19%, the price of gas in the U.S. hit $5 a gallon, and the inflation rate reached 9.1%. In less than a year, the Fed has raised interest rates 4.5%. The housing market got crushed. And the most popular investing strategy for those saving for retirement endured its worst year on record. All things that have improved in 2023. And if there's one theme that been pervasive in markets and the economy for some time now it's a sense from investors and consumers that the worst is yet to come. Economists at Wells Fargo said in a note consumer confidence data ""pours some cold water on the streak of strong economic data received to start the year."" Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, said Tuesday, ""if consumers drive the economy, the outlook for 2023 is bleak as the consumers expect that the worst is yet to come."" On Tuesday, The Conference Board's Expectations Index stood at 69.7, notable as any reading below 80 is typically consistent with recession, according to the report. This index, however, has been below 80 for 11 of the last 12 months. And we wait for the recession still. Solomon said there is typically a ""4 to 6 quarter lag before people reset their expectations."" The question, then, is in which direction do consumers and businesses need to reset expectations against those held today. And, once they do, will it already be too late?

2023-02-28,goog,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-february-28-2023-120603661.html,"U.S. stocks fell Tuesday, rounding out the last day of a volatile month of February on Wall Street. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) edged lower by 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined 0.7%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ticked down by 0.1%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked up to 3.92% Tuesday afternoon. The U.S. benchmark WTI crude oil moved higher to trade around $76.94 a barrel. The dollar index was up, trading at $104.92. Stocks closed higher on Monday, fueling a temporary rebound from Wall Street's worst week of the year. All three indexes ended February in the red after an optimistic start to the year in January. Economic data released on Tuesday showed that retail inventories, excluding auto, rose 0.3%, higher than 0.1% expected by economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Meanwhile, wholesale inventories declined 0.4%, below consensus estimates of 0.1%. American consumers felt worse about the economy in February, the Confidence Board reported. The board's Consumer Confidence Index slumped to 102.9 from 106.0, below consensus estimates of 108.5,  Meanwhile, February Chicago PMI dipped to 43.6 from 44.3, also below consensus expectations. “Consumers and businesses are looking for ways to reduce expenses in anticipation of much weaker activity over the rest of the year. The drop in consumer confidence in February aligns with weaker business confidence readings as the Fed’s sharp increase in interest rates start to bite,"" Ben Ayers, Nationwide senior economist, wrote in a statement. Other data showed that home prices fell 0.5% in December, according to data from S&P Corelogic Case-Shiller Index. On a yearly basis, home prices rose 4.6%, lower than analysts' expectations of 4.8%. As inflation still remains sticky, Federal Reserve Governor Philip Jefferson on Monday shot down arguments for raising the central bank’s 2% inflation target and said he is under ""no illusion"" that it's going to be easy to get the inflation rate back down. This week, investors will remain focused on the retail sector. On Tuesday, earnings from Target (TGT) topped analysts' expectations as consumer spending continues to move away from discretionary categories. The retailer’s same-store sales grew by 0.7%, above estimates of a 1.74% decline. The stock rose about 1% on Tuesday. Data from Bespoke Investment Group showed that over the last week, 420 stocks have reported earnings and the percentage of companies lowering guidance is more than double the percentage raising guidance, signaling ""lots of trouble for these smaller-cap companies that report late in the season."" In other single stock moves, Zoom (ZM) shares rose after the company posted better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings, with earnings per share of $1.22 higher than estimates of 80 cents. Revenue came in at $1.12 billion. Occidental Petroleum (OXY) shares moved down on Tuesday after the oil and gas producer posted fourth-quarter results that came in below Wall Street expectations on revenue and earnings per share. Shares of Workday (WDAY) were up after the human-resources software company topped expectations with revenue of $1.65 billion, up 20% year-over-year, against estimates of $1.63 billion. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (AMC) fell jumped on Tuesday after a Delaware court said it would hold a hearing on April 27, which will likely delay the date of conversion of convertible units APE to common stock. Tesla (TSLA) shares fell around 1% as Mexico's president confirmed that the EV maker will build a new plant in Monterrey, Mexico. The Mexican president said more details will be released at Tesla's investor day, and he said the plant is expected to be ""very big."" Shares of Coinbase (COIN) surged as fears of crypto regulation begin to fade. On Monday, the company was served a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission as the regulatory agency cracks down on cryptocurrency listings, its custody of digital assets and platform operations, and more, the company disclosed. Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) shares sank after the company reported a wider-than-expected loss and forecasted disappointing guidance for 2023 as the cruise operator gets squeezed by soaring fuel and labor costs. Separately, Bank of Nova Scotia shares dropped after the Canadian lender reported a missed in earnings estimates as a lull in its investment banking division dented income from its capital markets unit. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. Today the process opens for semiconductor companies to apply for a piece of the $39 billion grant money being allocated as part of the CHIPS and Science Act. But there's a catch: firms that win the funds may not be able to buy back stock – for a while, anyway. “We want to make sure that their money is being used to increase research and development in innovation and not to pad their bottom line or do buybacks,” said Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in an interview with Yahoo Finance. One could argue it’s the administration’s prerogative to decide how chipmakers that accept grants to build factories use that money. But the White House wants to go further, by boosting taxes on buybacks from their current 1%. In his State of the Union address earlier this month, President Joe Biden said that tax should be much higher: ""Corporations ought to do the right thing. That’s why I propose we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks and encourage long-term investments. They’ll still make considerable profit."" That proposal is what may have led Warren Buffett to weigh in on the hot-button issue in the Berkshire Hathaway CEO’s annual letter to investors: “When you are told that all repurchases are harmful to shareholders or to the country, or particularly beneficial to CEOs, you are listening to either an economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue (characters that are not mutually exclusive).” Even Buffett has a caveat, however: he says buybacks make sense only if they are made at “value-accretive prices,” i.e. when corporations don’t overpay. Taking a step back, corporations have a number of ways to spend their money, from building new plants to hiring people to research and development. They can also distribute the funds directly to shareholders by paying out dividends. Or they can repurchase shares, which has the effect of reducing overall share count, automatically increasing earnings per share. (In a simplified example, if a company makes $1 million in profit and has 50,000 shares outstanding, earnings per share are $20. If it buys back 10,000 of its shares, earnings per share go to $25, making an existing shareholder's stake more valuable.) And the numbers are a lot bigger than in the example above. Last year, U.S. companies announced a record $1.223 trillion of buybacks, according to data from EPFR TrimTabs. This year, it’s already running at $274.9 billion — heating up even after the 1% tax kicked in. Eliminating or restricting that tool, then, would be a big deal. Will it actually happen? In the case of companies accepting money as part of the CHIPS Act, it’s unclear whether they’ll be barred from doing buybacks at all, or just directly using the funding they’ve received. (Senator Elizabeth Warren and some of her colleagues in Congress want the participants to be barred from doing buybacks for 10 years). Secretary Raimondo said each case will be different, but the government will in theory have the ability to claw back money in the “most extreme cases” if companies do not comply with their agreements, whether that deals with buybacks or other stipulations. Investors in companies like Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) should take note, since they’re among the firms that have announced plans to build plants in the U.S. and are likely to apply for federal funding. As for whether a broader clampdown on buybacks is coming, policy analyst Ed Mills is skeptical. “Really, what this is about is setting up a strawman, as we get into debates about the debt ceiling,” Mills, a managing director at Raymond James, told Yahoo Finance in an interview. On the one hand, Republicans will fire up their rhetoric about getting the U.S. fiscal house in order. Democrats, led by President Biden, are likely to shoot back by saying Republicans aren’t willing to ask companies enacting big buybacks to pay more in taxes. “I don't think it happens, but I think it's going to be more part of the conversation than I think the market anticipates right now,” Mills said.

The Minneapolis-based retailer saw same-store sales increase by 0.7%, higher than Wall Street estimates of -1.74%. Similar to Walmart's (WMT) latest quarterly results, consumer spending at Target seemed to shift to essentials like food and away from categories like electronics, home, and apparel. Target shares jumped by more than 3.5% in pre-market trading after the report's release. Target CEO Brian Cornell said the team was pleased with the sales growth in what continues to be a ""very challenging environment."" Here's what Target reported, compared to Wall Street estimates, based on Bloomberg consensus data: Revenue: $31.40 billion versus $30.46 billion expected Adjusted earnings per share: $1.89 versus $1.48 expected Same-store sales: 0.7% versus -1.74% expected Brick & mortar same-store sales: up 1.9% versus -2.80% expected Cornell said having multiple category offerings, including food & beverage, in addition to beauty and household items served the retailer well this past quarter, Cornell said. ""Strength in Food & Beverage, Beauty and Household Essentials offset ongoing softness in discretionary categories. This performance highlights the benefit of our multi-category merchandise assortment, which drives relevance with our guests in any environment, and is a key reason we grew traffic every quarter last year."" Same-store sales beat estimates, up 0.7% compared to expectations of a decline of 1.74%. Same-store sales at physical locations also got a boost, up 1.9%, while digital sales dropped 3.6% in Q4. At the end of Q4, inventory was 3% lower than 2021. Meanwhile, in discretionary categories like electronics, home and apparel, inventory was nearly 13% lower than 2021, ""partially offset by higher inventory in frequency categories."" For full-year fiscal 2022 results, revenue grew by $3 billion, to $109 billion. Compared to 2019, revenue is up more than $30 billion. In the full-year, same-store sales increased 2.2%, while traffic was up 2.1%. Looking ahead to fiscal 2023, Cornell said the retailer is focused on it's long-term strategy and ""continued differentiation through affordability, assortment, ease and convenience"" as it competes with other retailers for consumers trading down. ""At the same time, we’re planning our business cautiously in the near term to ensure we remain agile and responsive to the current operating environment...as we plan for the year ahead, we will continue to make robust capital investments and pursue efficiency opportunities in support of our long-term growth."" For the first-quarter of 2023, the company expects a wide range for same-store sales, from a low-single digit decline to a low-single increase, and an operating income margin rate of 4-5%. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.50 to $1.90. For fiscal-year 2023, the company expects same-store sales to be the same, from low-single digit to a low-single increase, along with an operating income of more than $1 billion and adjusted EPS to range from $7.75 to $8.75. In the next 3 years, the company aims to move beyond its pre-pandemic operating income margin rate of 6%, and says it could possibly reach that goal as early as fiscal 2024, ""depending on the speed of recovery for the economy and consumer demand."" — Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose by 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.2%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased by 0.6%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked down to 3.93% Monday. On the economic data side, new orders for manufactured durable goods in January plunged to 4.5%, the biggest drop since April 2020, the Census Bureau reported. The drop was more pronounced than economist estimates of 4.0%. ""The manufacturing sector will remain under pressure in the months ahead, but the details of January's report of durable goods orders and shipments suggest factory activity started the year on a better note than the headline figure would suggest,"" Lydia Boussour, EY Parthenon senior economist, wrote in a statement following the release. Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors’ index of pending home sales climbed 8.1% to 82.5 in January, sharply higher from the projected rise of 1.0% by Bloomberg economists, according to data the group released on Monday. On a yearly basis, however, pending transactions plunged by nearly 24%. ""The increase in the Pending Home Sales Index confirms that the US housing market has improved, or better put, has somewhat stabilized over the last several months due to lower mortgage interest rates,"" Raymond James chief economist Eugenio Aleman wrote in statement to Yahoo Finance. ""However, the recent increase in mortgage rates is probably going to inflict some more pain on the US housing market going forward."" Stocks closed out their worst week of 2023 on Friday after the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge showed it unexpectedly accelerated in January and consumer spending jumped. The “core” Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index – which excludes volatile food and energy components – showed prices climbed 0.6% in January and 4.7% from last year. The Commerce Department also reported consumer spending rose 1.8% last month from December, the largest increase in nearly two years. The survey’s results renewed anxiety among investors that the Fed would continue its aggressive tightening campaign against inflation. The drop in optimism pressured the major indexes, as the Dow Jones dropped 3% for its fourth consecutive losing week, while the S&P 500 shed 2.7% in its worst week since early December and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.3%. Data compiled by 22V Research has found that rising interest rates have increased the correlation between growth and value stocks to the highest level since at least 2005. This week, investors will remain keen on the retail sector, with earnings from Target (TGT) on deck before market open on Tuesday after Walmart (WMT) warned of cautious profit guidance for the year ahead. Home improvement retail giant Home Depot (HD) also had disappointing guidance for fiscal 2023. Elsewhere on the earnings calendar are results from Costco (COST), Macy's (M), Dollar Tree (DLTR), and Kohl's (KSS) to feature the retail side. Meanwhile, the share of companies topping analysts' expectations in the fourth quarter has been low compared to history. Data from FactSet showed that 68% of S&P 500 companies reported fourth quarter earnings that beat expectations, down from the five-year average of 77% and the 10-year average of 73%. In single stock moves, Seagen Inc. (SGEN) shares jumped Monday morning after a report from The Wall Street Journal said Pfizer (PFE) is in early-stage talks to acquire the cancer drugmaker company in what could be a multi-billion dollar deal. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK-B) stock rose following CEO Warren Buffett’s annual letter to shareholders, which offered readers a glimpse into his views on share buybacks, taxes, corporate accounting, and his sense of optimism about the economy. Shares of fuboTV (FUBO) sank after the sports-focused streaming service issued disappointing guidance in its fourth-quarter earnings report on Monday and disclosed that it had sold stock at a deeply discounted price. Fisker (FSR) shares jumped Monday after the electric vehicle startup announced its deliveries for its first vehicle, the Ocean SUV, would be completed by spring. Shares of Union Pacific (UNP) climbed after the largest freight operator announced its plans to name a new chief executive following pressure from activists to oust Lance Fritz from the job. Bath & Body Works (BBWI) shares fell after the company said in a letter to shareholders that the looming proxy battle is based on ""misguided"" motivations and would be detrimental to shareholders. The board made the decision to not appoint former Third Point co-chief investment officer Munib Islam. Elsewhere, in cryptocurrency news, Coinbase (COIN) said in a tweet that it will soon suspend trading for Binance's stablecoin, Binance USD, on March 13 at or around noon ET.

Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. Salesforce is facing a defining moment in its 24-year history. Growth is slowing. Analysts are worried fundamentals will get worse before they get better as companies curtail tech spending amid a sluggish global economy. A fresh round of layoffs at Salesforce have just been uncorked....at a company that has only known aggressive hiring. Employees are questioning leadership at the tech titan. Co-CEO Bret Taylor is no longer co-CEO of Salesforce — instead he's off to launch an AI startup the serial entrepreneur tells me. Slack founder Stewart Butterfield, who stayed on when the company was acquired by Salesforce, is still founder...but no longer with the parent company. Salesforce co-founder Marc Benioff is back at the CEO helm, after attempting again to pullback from day to day duties (by delegating to a co-CEO) and focus more on his vast philanthropic ventures. To top it all off the company is staring down the barrel of five sharks in the field of activist money management: Elliott Management, Starboard Value, Inclusive Capital, ValueAct, and Third Point. This is an unprecedented activist versus public company battle, pros have told Yahoo Finance. How it ends is wildly unclear, but is a situation just as important as Wednesday's earnings report. ""While the involvement of five activist investors has likely been the primary driver of CRM stock of late, quarterly results probably still matter (though not as much as usual), and how those results are delivered may be more relevant than ever,"" said Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci. Below, Yahoo Finance breaks down this complicated situation at large-cap tech name Salesforce. The drama is high, and it could all be coming down to one final epic conclusion. What Yahoo Finance Is Watching: Salesforce Earnings What sources tell us is top of mind on the Street: How quickly are sales deteriorating inside of the broader tech pullback? What does the pipeline of future business look like? Does Marc Benioff acknowledge the activist situation? Are more layoffs needed? Consensus is that Salesforce warns on sales and earnings for 2023 – but how bad is it? The Vibe Among Wall Street Analysts Analysts are generally expecting a muted tone from Salesforce on earnings day. “For Benioff and Salesforce the actual quarter and FY24 take a back seat to the fluid activist situation which is happening at Salesforce with the Street's patience wearing thin after a head scratcher Slack deal and slowing growth/underachieving margins front and center.” -Wedbush analyst Dan Ives ""Key to the Q4 call is gaining clarity on the extent to which management will turn the dial up on non-GAAP operating margins, GAAP profitability, and any future share repurchases with the emergence of activist involvement in the stock."" -Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss What the Activists Want From Salesforce Sources tell Yahoo Finance that Starboard Value — led by veteran activist investor and Papa John's chairman Jeff Smith — has been disappointed in Salesforce’s expense management, but isn’t advocating for a sale of Slack. Other activists involved in the situation are keen to see a Slack sale even at a low price as a show of faith by management they will improve margins, sources say. Overall, we are told the activists are entrenched and want clear changes from Salesforce leadership. Key thing the activist pool wants: Higher profit margins Realistic 2023 guidance Clear succession plan from CEO co-founder Marc Benioff Like we said, this earnings report is a defining moment in the history of Salesforce.

2023-02-26,goog,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stocks-under-pressure-retail-earnings-continue-what-to-know-this-week-142308388.html,"The 2023 stock market rally is under pressure. Inflation data last week that topped expectations — as well as a continued drop in optimism the Federal Reserve's rate hikes will end sooner rather than later — pressured the major indexes with the Dow logging a fourth-straight losing week and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq suffering their worst weeks of the year, losing 2.7% and 3.4%, respectively. The Dow endured its worst weekly performance since Sept. 2022. In the week ahead, investors will remain keyed in on the retail sector, with results from Target (TGT) in focus after rival Walmart (WMT) issued a warning on the state of U.S. consumers last week. On the economic data side, a crowded calendar of reports from the housing and manufacturing sectors — two areas of the economy which have most reflected the impact of policy tightening — is on tap along with a key measure of consumer confidence. On Friday, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index — the Fed's preferred assessment of how quickly prices are rising across the economy — showed prices rose 0.6% during the month of January and 5.4% over last year. On a ""core"" basis, which strips out volatile food and energy components, prices rose 0.6% for the month and at an annual clip of 4.7%. The week marked a turning point in sentiment around inflation expectations and the path forward for interest rates. The hotter-than-expected PCE index followed upside surprises to inflation this year from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and producer prices, which showed the largest increases in several months to start the year. ""The bear market rally that began in October from reasonable prices and low expectations has morphed into a speculative frenzy based on a Fed pause/pivot that isn't coming,"" Morgan Stanley's top strategist Mike Wilson said in a note to clients last week. Wilson's forecast sees the S&P 500 bottoming out at 3,000 this year. On Friday, the benchmark U.S. equity index closed at 3,970. ""Investor optimism had already been hit by a slow puncture this week but it's deflating more rapidly as the latest data indicates that the work in taming inflation is far from over,"" Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in a note. Standout economic data releases in the week ahead include the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index, ISM's manufacturing PMI, and The Conference Board's consumer confidence reading for February. On the corporate side, Target will release its fourth-quarter earnings results before market open on Tuesday with results from Costco (COST), Macy's (M), Dollar Tree (DLTR), and Kohl's (KSS) also featuring on the retail side. Last week, Walmart's CFO John David Rainey said the ""consumer is still very pressured, and if you look at economic indicators, balance sheets are running thinner and savings rates are declining relative to previous periods."" ""We expect Target's results will look similar to Walmart's, with better-than-expected sales, more gross margin pressure than predicted, and solid opex leverage in the store,"" Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe said in a note. Tarlowe warned, however, Target is not ""immune to consumer spending trends shifting to the more needs-based items and away from higher-priced and higher-margin discretionary categories."" Elsewhere on the earnings calendar, notable reports include Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Zoom Video (ZM), AMC Entertainment (AMC), Rivian Automotive (RIVN), and Dell (DELL) among others. — Monday: Durable Goods Orders, January Preliminary (-3.8% expected, 5.6% during prior month); Durables Excluding Transportation, January Preliminary (0.1% expected, -0.2% during prior month); Non-defense Capital Goods Orders Excluding Aircraft, January Preliminary (0.0% expected, -0.1% during prior month); Non-defense Capital Goods Shipments Excluding Aircraft, January Preliminary (-0.6% during prior month); Pending Home Sales, month-over-month, January (1.0% expected, 2.5% during prior month); Pending Home Sales NSA, year-over-year, January (-34.3% during prior month); Dallas Fed Manufacturing Activity, February (-9.10 expected, -8.4 during prior month) Tuesday: Advance Goods Trade Balance, January (-$91.0 billion expected, -$90.3 billion during prior month, revised to -$89.7 billion); Wholesale Inventories, month-over-month, January Preliminary (0.1% expected, 0.1% during previous month); Retail Inventories, month-over-month, January (0.5% during prior month); House Price Purchase Index, quarter-over-quarter, Q4 (0.1% during prior quarter); FHFA Housing Pricing Index, December (-0.1% during prior month); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City Composite, month-over-month, December (-0.54% during prior month); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City Composite, year-over-year, December (6.77% during prior month); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, year-over-year, December (7.69% during prior month); MNI Chicago PMI, February (44.3 during prior month); Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index, February (-11 during prior month); Conference Board Consumer Confidence, February (108.5 expected, 107.1 during prior month); Richmond Fed Business Conditions, February (-10 during prior month); Dallas Fed Services Activity, February (-15.0 during prior month) Wednesday: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Feb. 24 (-13.3% during prior week); S&P Global U.S. Manufacturing PMI, February Final (47.8 prior); Construction Spending, month-over-month, January (0.4% expected, -0.4% during prior month); ISM Manufacturing, February (47.9 expected, 47.4 during prior month); ISM Prices Paid, February (44.5 during prior month); ISM Employment, February (50.6 during prior month); ISM New Orders, February (42.5 during prior month); Wards Total Vehicle Sales, February (15.00 million, 15.74 million during prior month) Thursday: Unit Labor Costs, Q4 Final (2.5% expected, 3.0% during prior quarter); Nonfarm Productivity, Q4 Final (1.5% expected, 1.1% during prior quarter); Initial Jobless Claims, week ended Feb. 24 (TK expected, 192,000 during prior week); Continuing Claims, week ended Feb. 18 (1.654 million during prior week) Friday: S&P Global U.S. Services PMI, February Final (50.5 during prior month); S&P Global U.S. Services Composite PMI, February Final (50.2 during prior month); ISM Services Index, February (54.5 expected, 55.2 during prior month) — Monday: Groupon (GRPN), LendingTree (TREE), Li Auto (LI), Lordstown Motors (RIDE), Oak Street Health (OSH), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Workday (WDAY), Zoom Video (ZM) Tuesday: AMC Entertainment (AMC), AutoZone (AZO), Cracker Barrel (CBRL), Compass (COMP), Duolingo (DUOL), GoodRx (GDRX), HP (HP), J.M.

2023-02-24,goog,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-today-february-24-2023-104349492.html,"U.S. stocks tumbled Friday after the Federal Reserve's most closely watched inflation measure came in stronger than expected, in another sign that price pressures have become sticky into 2023. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) sank 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) plopped more than 300 points, or 1%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid 1.7%. Friday marked the worst week for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq since December. U.S. Treasury yields scrambled higher following the reading. The 2-year note surged 12 basis points to 4.81% while the 10-year note gained 7 basis points to top 3.95%. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index — the Fed's preferred assessment of how quickly prices are rising across the economy — rose 0.6% in January and 5.4% from last year. On a ""core"" basis, which strips out volatile food and energy components, prices rose 0.6% for the month and 4.7% from last year. The report from the Commerce Department also showed that consumer spending rose 1.8% last month from December after falling the previous month. The numbers support recent indications inflation is not falling at the pace and extent investors have been hoping for, even as prices have stabilized from the peaks of the current inflation cycle. “First December CPI was revised higher, and now each reading for January surprised to the upside. Inflation’s like an old boyfriend or girlfriend that keeps showing up when you don’t want to see them,"" David Russell, Vice President of Market Intelligence at TradeStation said in a note. In individual stock moves, Block (SQ) rose 4.3% after the payments processor reported fourth-quarter financial results that saw profit and revenue top expectations. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) shares fell 1% after the media giant posted a big revenue loss for the final three months of the year. Boeing (BA) shares closed down 4.8% after the airline manufacturer said it paused deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner jets because of a documentation issue. Beyond Meat's (BYND) stock rallied 10% after better-than-expected earnings and CEO Ethan Brown said the company is seeing progress in its efforts to cut costs and manufacturing hurdles. Beleaguered used car retailer (CVNA) plunged 20.5% after reporting a net loss that was nine times wider in the fourth quarter. The bumpier-than-anticipated road to restoring price stability and strong economic data to start the year — nonfarm payrolls rose by 517,000 in January while retail sales surged 3% — have prompted investors to readjust expectations around the path forward for interest rates, putting a dent in the market's recent momentum. The S&P 500 snapped a four-day losing streak on Thursday as stocks closed higher. But earlier this week on Tuesday, stocks had their worst day of the year. ""Equity bulls and even Chair Powell have bragged about anchored expectations for inflation and how consumers and investors believe it is moving in the right direction,"" Morgan Stanley Chief Investment Officer Lisa Shalett said in a note earlier this week, noting that January's Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) raised questions about whether inflation progress is stalling. ""Given data crosscurrents, the central bank needs to tread carefully. Investors still wagering on a 'Fed put; or quick return to financial repression are apt to be wrong this time,"" Shalett said. ""Fed credibility is on the line, and it is likely to risk overshooting rather than quitting the inflation fight too early."" — Alexandra Semenova is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-02-24,goog,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/fed-inflation-fight-longer-pce-index-173353572.html,"Two Federal Reserve officials suggested Friday morning that inflation could persist longer than thought after the central bank's most closely watched inflation gauge surged by the most in months. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Fed Governor Philip Jefferson said they remain concerned about an inflation rate that remains well above the Fed's 2% year-over-year target. Mester reiterated that while inflation has moderated, the overall level remains too high. She noted recent research from the Cleveland Fed and a discussion paper that have suggested inflation could be more persistent than currently anticipated. “I see the risks to the inflation forecast as tilted to the upside and the costs of continued high inflation as being significant,” Mester said at the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum in New York. “So in my view, at this point, with the labor market still strong, the costs of undershooting on policy or prematurely loosening policy still outweigh the costs of overshooting.” The comments came as the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation – the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index – unexpectedly accelerated in January, rising 5.4% last month on an annual basis. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the inflation gage rose 4.7%, both marking pickups after several months of declines. On a monthly basis, the PCE index rose 0.6% in January compared with December. Core prices also rose 0.6% in January from the prior month, compared with December’s 0.4% increase. The numbers Friday came a week after the government released the Consumer Price Index, which showed a similar pickup in the inflation rate. The hot read on inflation hit markets on renewed rate hike fears, with the Dow Jones Industrial average tanking 336 points. ""By betting on a terminal rate above 5.35%, the market is effectively betting that the recent momentum in both growth and inflation will be sustained through the summer,"" Jefferies chief economist Aneta Markowska said. Mester, who does not vote on monetary policy decisions this year, told Bloomberg in an interview Friday morning that the latest inflation reading shows the Fed needs to keep raising interest rates but stopped short of suggesting it required a 50-basis-point rate hike at the next policy meeting in March. Mester said last week she wanted to raise the benchmark policy rate by 50 basis points at the last policy meeting to try to get to the peak rate faster, though she also didn't want to surprise markets. In a separate interview Friday morning with CNBC, Mester signaled her forecast in December to raise rates a bit above 5% hasn’t changed much. Speaking at the same Monetary Policy Forum on Friday, Boston Fed President Susan Collins said inflation is still too high and that the Fed has more work to do. “Inflation remains too high, and recent data …all reinforce my view that we have more work to do, to bring inflation down to the 2 percent target,” said Collins. “I anticipate further rate increases to reach a sufficiently restrictive level, then holding there for some, perhaps extended, time.” Also speaking at the conference, Jefferson said a limited supply of workers for jobs needed, which has pushed up wages, suggests inflation may cool slowly. “The ongoing imbalance between the supply and demand for labor, combined with the large share of labor costs in the services sector, suggests that high inflation may come down only slowly,” he said. Jefferson also said the forces driving inflation now are different that past inflationary episodes and therefore economic models won’t be as helpful to policymakers. Jefferson said the current situation is different because the pandemic created unprecedented disruptions to global supply chains and is having a long-lasting impact on the labor participation rate. “The inflationary forces impinging on the U.S. economy at present represent a complex mixture of temporary and more long-lasting elements that defy simple, parsimonious explanation,” he said. Jefferson says he thinks the Fed is addressing the spike in inflation proactively, unlike in the 1970s and has more credibility now.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. What's old may be new again for U.S. stock investors. The end of zero-interest rate policies (ZIRP) is likely to mark a shift in equity market favorites from long-leading technology names to sectors like energy, materials and housing — or what strategists at Bank of America deem part of ""the old economy."" ""Bear markets have historically resulted in leadership change, which suggests old economy sectors are likely the winners of this cycle,"" Savita Subramanian, BofA’s head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy said in a note earlier this week. With these components of the market depleted of capital over the past ten years as Big Tech was powered by free money, the ""pendulum is expected to swing back"" in their direction, Subramanian noted. Despite the big gains across January in these very stocks that were battered throughout 2022, investors have called the moves higher this year a bear market rally rather than the start of a new bull market. ""I think the stock market is in a protracted bear market,"" DoubleLine Capital founder and CEO Jeffrey Gundlach told Yahoo Finance Live in an interview Wednesday (video above), adding it began in the fourth quarter of 2021. ""[It's] very negative for the stock market when you have rising interest rates against these valuations, especially real interest rates,"" Gundlach said, adding a pause in the increase in real rates this fall was a catalyst for the recovery in risk assets. ""But it looks like real interest rates might start rising again."" Meanwhile on Sunday, Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson told clients in a not that the recent rally was ""a speculative frenzy"" based on false hopes for a pivot by the Federal Reserve. Equity markets are in the throes of a recent shift in the narrative for where interest rates will go, finally taking Fed officials at face value as they vow to lift their policy rate above 5% this year. Bank of America indicated its analysis of equity risk premium shows growth stocks were not pricing in recession risk and the expected higher-for-longer rate environment is projected to pressure long-duration growth stocks. Whatever the rest of the year holds for the U.S. stock market, signs have already emerged of an imminent change in leadership. Last year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average crushed the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite, for example, falling less than 10% in 2022 while the latter index wiped out more than one third of its value. As Yahoo Finance’s Jared Blikre pointed out, the Dow’s outperformance relative to the tech index was by far the biggest gap since the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. Goldman Sachs’s chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin warned in November that the ""exceptionalism of technology is arguably behind us. In 2022, the aggregate market capitalization of the current ""tetrad of largest stocks,"" as Goldman Sachs put it — Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) – fell to 18% from 22% the prior year. And those top four stocks lost an aggregate -25% compared to -13% for the remaining stocks in the index during the period. ""With the end of ZIRP, we see the pendulum swinging back to the old economy as prolonged underinvestment has led to supply issues in the old economy,"" Subramanian said. Bank of America itself raised metals to overweight, and is overweight energy, a testament to its confidence in the leadership transition.

2023-03-10,goog,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/1-us-judge-says-order-160216653.html,"(Adds detail from arguments from Google and DOJ attorneys, background) By Diane Bartz ALEXANDRIA, Virginia, March 10 (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge said on Friday that a Justice Department lawsuit against Alphabet's Google regarding its dominance of advertising technology would remain in Virginia, rejecting Google's bid to move it to New York. ""I am going to rule against you,"" Judge Leonie Brinkema told an attorney for Google. The government, which filed the ad tech lawsuit in January along with eight states, accused the company of abusing its dominance of the digital advertising business and argued that it should be forced to sell its ad manager suite, which brought in 12% of the company's revenue in 2021. Google has denied any wrongdoing in running its ad tech business. Google had asked for the case to be moved to Manhattan federal court, where the company is fighting similar claims, including one brought by the Texas attorney general in 2020. Eric Mahr, an attorney for Google, argued that there was a risk of an inconsistent judgment if the case were not moved to New York. Justice Department attorney Julia Wood said there would be significant inefficiencies for the federal government if it were required to join the larger case being heard in New York. Wood also said there were ""meaningful differences"" between the Justice Department's case and many of the New York cases. The Justice Department's ad tech lawsuit follows a separate lawsuit filed in 2020, the tail end of the Trump administration, that accused Google of violating antitrust law to maintain its dominance in search. That case goes to trial in September. The lawsuit comes as the Biden administration seeks to toughen antitrust enforcement. Not only is it seeking to rein in a tech giant with its Google suit, but it has a long list of merger challenges. The search and advertising giant, which also makes a smartphone operating system and owns YouTube, faces antitrust lawsuits around the world with most based on abuse of dominance of one sort or another. U.S. courts facing transfer requests weigh a variety of factors, including location of witnesses and evidence. (Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Tim Ahmann)"

Meta, Alphabet, Amazon and CarMax were all top detractors for the quarter and calendar year periods (FIS and Liberty Broadband, respectively, complete the quarterly and calendar-year detractor lists.)

Drawdowns of this magnitude are painful, and it may be prudent for management to moderate the pace of some investments, but we remain encouraged by their long-term focus.

SVB stock plummeted 68% during Friday's premarket trading session before the halt after dropping more than 60% through Thursday, closing at $106 per share. CNBC's David Faber reported early Friday SVB's planned capital raise announced earlier this week had not cleared the market, and that the firm was now seeking to sell itself. Turmoil for SVB began when the California based bank filed a surprise announcement of a $1.8 billion loss following a deposit outflow and plans to raise $2.25 billion by selling common and preferred stock. Silicon Valley Bank primarily serves startups and technology firms, which have been under pressure as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.  Silicon Valley’s CEO Greg Becker urged calm with venture capitalists Thursday in a call, according to The Information, and asked them not to withdraw money. Bloomberg reported that venture capitalists have urged portfolio companies to trim their exposure to the lender. Another California bank that serves cryptocurrency clients, Silvergate Capital, announced a “voluntary liquidation” Wednesday, the same day Silicon Valley Bank announced its ill-fated capital raise. Shares were also halted in Signature Bank (SBNY), a New York institution that serves some cryptocurrency clients, after its shares dropped more than 16%. First Republic Bank (FRC), which serves some companies in the venture world and also targets high-net worth clients from the tech industry, saw shares fall as much as 40% early Friday. Concerns about risks to other banks spread on Thursday as stocks of giant financial institutions tumbled. A major bank index fell by the most Thursday in nearly three years. Shares for JP Morgan Chase (JPM) fell 5.41% Thursday and shares were roughly flat during Friday's open. Shares of Bank of America (BAC) fell 6.20% Thursday and opened Friday down more than 2%. Citigroup (C) shares fell 4.20% Thursday and opened Friday down more than 1%. Shares of Goldman Sachs Group (GS) fell 7.20% Thursday and an additional 2% Friday. In a Friday morning note, Morgan Stanley analysts said they don’t anticipate this SVB Financial’s challenges will cripple other regional banks. “The funding pressures facing SIVB are highly idiosyncratic and should not be viewed as a read-across to other regional banks,” according to the note. “We do not believe there is a liquidity crunch facing the banking industry, and most banks in our coverage have ample access to liquidity.” David Hollerith is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.4%. “Signs of slowing outnumber signs of strength, making the chance that last month was a fluke likely,” Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, wrote in a note Friday morning. “At the same time, labor demand continues strong, which suggests a significant drop is also unlikely. A return to the previous trend makes the most sense.” The Federal Reserve has been keeping a close eye on all fronts to the labor market as the central bank tries to cool down inflation. The Friday’s jobs print will show whether January’s hiring gain was an outlier or the start of economic acceleration. Another key point of focus will be wage growth — and whether or not the trend accelerated last month. Meanwhile, other recent data continues to show the economy remains resilient. Consumer spending surged in January, inflation stayed sticky, and business activity expanded in February. The accumulation of economic data, coupled with comments this week from Chair Jerome Powell, has sparked the debate on whether a 0.25% or 0.50% rate hike from the Fed is likely for its March meeting. However, recent events in the banking world have spurred other concerns for Fed officials as their monetary tightening policy induces stresses into the banking system. A major tech firm lender revealed it’s in deep trouble. Silicon Valley Bank’s (SIVB) share price tanked 60% on Thursday, wiping out $9.6 billion of market value after announcing it needs to raise $2.25 billion to offset a $1.8 billion loss on some bond sales. The sour sentiment has spread across markets as the KBW Bank index (^BKX) was down over 7%, while index members including Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) edged lower Friday morning in premarket trading. Elsewhere, in the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin (BTC) crumbled below $20,000 Friday amid liquidation of Silvergate Capital (SI) and regulatory pressures on the industry. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-10,jnj,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/february-jobs-report-march-10-2023-124602371.html,"The February jobs report is expected to show a slowdown in job growth from the start of 2023 while reinforcing the U.S. labor market remains strong even in the face of stubbornly high inflation. Economists expect nonfarm payrolls grew by 225,000 last month with the unemployment rate expected to hold steady at 3.4%, according to data from Bloomberg. The BLS will release its latest jobs figures at 8:30 a.m. ET. Here are the key figures investors will be looking for in Friday's report compared to January's figures, according to data from Bloomberg: Nonfarm payrolls: +225,000 vs. +517,000 Unemployment rate: 3.4% vs. 3.4% Average hourly earnings, month-on-month: +0.3% vs. +0.3% Average hourly earnings, year-on-year: +4.7% vs. +4.4% Labor force participation rate: 62.4% vs. 62.4% Average weekly hours worked: 34.6 vs. 34.7 Investors will be paying particularly close attention to revisions to January's data released Friday morning, as investors saw the unexpectedly strong 517,000 jobs created to start the year as a potential outgrowth of seasonal adjustment factors or favorable weather. ""Given the potential impact of weather and seasonality effects in January there is the possibility of another shock last month, albeit mainly to the downside this time,"" wrote Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients earlier this month. Ashworth expects job gains in February will tally 200,000 just below consensus estimates. Friday's report also comes less than two weeks before the Federal Reserve's next policy meeting, with markets now expecting the central bank will raise interest rates by a more aggressive 0.50%. Fed Chair Jay Powell told lawmakers this week ""the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated."" Data from the CME Group shows markets pricing in an 60% of a 0.50% rate hike on March 22. An employment report that is in-line with expectations could clinch that more aggressive move later this month.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. For the last year, the Federal Reserve has tried to accomplish one goal, using one tool — lower inflation by raising interest rates. The result has been benchmark interest rates rising by 4.5% in a year and headline inflation falling from a peak of 9.1% in June to 6.4% as of January. As Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated in testimony on Capitol Hill this week, there is still work to be done for the Fed to achieve its goal. But over the last week, acute challenges at two banks have surfaced another issue now facing the Powell Fed. And that is the stability of the financial system. On Wednesday, Silvergate Capital (SI), which had become one of the crypto industry's biggest banking partners, announced it will liquidate and wind down operations after suffering significant deposit outflows from its digital asset clients. That same day, Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB), the preferred banking partner of the venture and startup worlds, announced it would take a $1.8 billion loss while liquidating its entire short-term securities book and raising $2.25 billion fresh capital. In a letter to investors, CEO Greg Becker assured investors the bank had ""ample liquidity,"" and said it took these actions ""because we expect continued higher interest rates, pressured public and private markets, and elevated cash burn levels from our clients as they invest in their businesses."" The Information reported Thursday afternoon Becker told investors on a call, ""I would ask everyone to stay calm and to support us just like we supported you during the challenging times."" Few statements have a tougher audience than investors being told to remain calm in times of market stress. On Thursday, U.S. stocks got crushed during a steady, relentless sell-off that centered on the financial sector. Regional banks were hammered. Big banks were hammered. The S&P 500 fell 1.8%. Bitcoin fell 7%. The challenge for Powell, however, is that some of the stress facing Silicon Valley Bank has been induced by the Fed's actions to fight inflation. And the fear is they may not be alone. In the simplest terms, Silicon Valley Bank took a nearly $2 billion hit selling bonds at a loss to buy different bonds that offer a higher yield. The firm's latest annual report showed the bank owned about $14 billion in Treasury securities with an average maturity between 1-5 years. Today, 1-year Treasury bills yield 5.25%. One day's drop in the stock market, of course, is not cause for concern about the financial system. Even the liquidation of one bank and deep investor concerns about another need not constitute a Fed-level worry about the U.S. banking system. But these moves serve as reminders that while the central bank's role in raising or lowering interest rates has become the focal point of investor attention over the last decade, the Fed also serves the central role in stabilizing markets and quelling investor fears during uncertain moments like the present. Almost exactly three years ago, Powell held an emergency Sunday night call on March 15, 2020 to announce a series of measures aimed at supporting the economy as the pandemic rapidly shut down global business. On that call, Powell reminded the assembled press, ""[That] central banks were originally designed to ...provide liquidity to financial systems in stress, so we take that job very seriously. It's probably the most important thing we're doing now is that."" Rising anxiety in the banking system as the ripples from a crypto collapse in 2022 and the icing over of a red hot venture market pale in comparison to the financial emergency the Fed faced three years ago. But their actions then were a reminder of the central bank's power, and, indeed, its centrality to financial markets. When the February jobs report is released Friday morning, investors will pore over the data to decipher whether a 0.25% or 0.50% rate hike from the Fed is likely warranted on March 22. This is the moment markets have been building towards for weeks. But the unforeseen stress now being injected into the banking system makes Friday and the days ahead notable for the Fed in an entirely different manner. That presents to Jay Powell another wrinkle in the challenge of trying to bring order to an economy that busted and boomed in a few short months.

2023-03-10,jnj,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/why-silicon-valley-banks-crisis-is-rattling-americas-biggest-banks-121159393.html,"The problems of two small banks on the West Coast are rippling across markets and causing new investor concerns about some of the country’s largest financial institutions. Why? Three words: rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve’s aggressive campaign to bring down inflation helped set the stage for major problems at two California lending institutions — SVB Financial (SIVB) and Silvergate Capital (SI) — as an outflow of deposits forced both to sell assets at a loss. Those assets were bonds. Banks are big investors in assets like Treasury bills because they need lots of safe places to park their cash. Many financial institutions piled into these investments during a period of historically-low interest rates that spanned the early years of the pandemic, as banks took in tons of new deposits and lending was somewhat restrained. But now the Fed is hiking rates at a rapid clip, with Fed Chair Jay Powell warning earlier this week the central bank may have to speed up the pace of its rate increases to cool the economy further. The problem that creates for banks is simple: higher rates lower the value of their existing bonds. The withdrawals at SVB's Silicon Valley Bank have come from startups and technology firms, many of which also ran into new trouble once the Fed began raising rates. The deposit outflow forced SVB to sell assets and take a $1.8 billion loss, a move the bank it made “because we expect continued higher interest rates, pressured public and private markets, and elevated cash-burn levels from our clients as they invest in their businesses.” Its shares fell more than 60% Thursday. In pre-market trade on Friday SVB shares were down another 60% after overnight reporting from Bloomberg said VC firms ranging from Peter Thiel's Founder Fund to Union Square Ventures had told portfolio companies to pull their money from Silicon Valley Bank. Banks don't have to realize losses on bonds that may have gone down in value amid rising rates if they're not pushed to sell these assets. But Silvergate Capital and SVB Financial didn’t have that choice. Customer withdrawals at Silvergate Bank and SVB’s Silicon Valley Bank forced their hand. At Silvergate, which caters to cryptocurrency clients, customers yanked their money in the panic that followed the 2022 collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Silvergate said in January that it had realized losses of $886 million from selling securities as deposits fell. That weakened the bank considerably. On Wednesday it said it would wind down its bank, and its shares plunged Thursday. After disclosing the $1.8 billion loss and new capital raise, Silicon Valley’s CEO Greg Becker urged calm in a call with venture capitalists Thursday, according to The Information, asking these investors not to withdraw money. It now is seeking to raise $2.25 billion of new capital to cover the new losses. The concern now among investors is that much bigger banks could be forced to do the same. That sent the stocks of giant financial institutions tumbling Thursday, including the biggest of the big: JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC). A major bank index fell by the most Thursday in nearly three years. The biggest U.S. banks are much stronger than they were in the lead up to the last big banking crisis, in 2008, in part because regulators forced them to hold more capital and survive numerous stress test scenarios over the last decade and a half. And the giants have more diverse funding and customer bases than banks such as Silicon Valley or Silvergate, which gives them many more options during challenging times. Longtime banking analyst Mike Mayo said Thursday during an appearance on CNBC the biggest banks are ""a pillar of strength and stability"" and much more resilient than they were prior to the 2008 crisis. ""The biggest risks are outside the largest banks,"" he said, and yet all banks are ""getting painted with the same brush."" Bank stocks, he said, ""have gotten Powelled,"" referring to the Fed chair. ""Going from zero to 5% interest rates in a period that is faster than any time in four decades, you are going to have casualties."" Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chair Martin Gruenberg highlighted the new interest rate risks facing the industry during a speech on March 6, noting that unrealized losses on available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities totaled $620 billion at the end of 2022 across all U.S. banks. ""The current interest rate environment has had dramatic effects on the profitability and risk profile of banks’ funding and investment strategies,"" he said. ""First, as a result of the higher interest rates, longer term maturity assets acquired by banks when interest rates were lower are now worth less than their face values. The result is that most banks have some amount of unrealized losses on securities."" These unrealized losses, he added, ""weaken a bank’s future ability to meet unexpected liquidity needs."" The good news, according to Gruenberg, is that ""banks are generally in a strong financial condition, and have not been forced to realize losses by selling depreciated securities.""

2023-03-09,jnj,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-today-live-updates-march-9-2023-135006552.html,"Stocks got crushed on Thursday as worries rippled through the banking sector and investors remained on edge ahead of a crucial February jobs report slated for Friday morning. At the closing bell, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down 1.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was off by 1.6%, or 542 points, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down by 2%. Through Thursday's close the market was on pace for its worst week of the year, Bloomberg data showed. The selling on Thursday accelerated throughout the trading session as a collapse in shares of SVB Financial (SIVB) pressured bank stocks and raised concerns over previously unforeseen knock-on effects from the Federal Reserve's rate hiking campaign on the financial system. On Wednesday, SVB announced a $2.25 billion capital raise and the sale of nearly all of its securities portfolio for a loss of $1.8 billion. The company's Silicon Valley Bank subsidiary is the bank for many startups and other players in the venture world. In a letter to investors on Wednesday, the company said: ""We are taking these actions because we expect continued higher interest rates, pressured public and private markets, and elevated cash burn levels from our clients as they invest in their businesses."" The Information reported Thursday afternoon Greg Becker, CEO of Silicon Valley Bank, said on a call with investors, ""I would ask everyone to stay calm and to support us just like we supported you during the challenging times."" Becker also reportedly told investors the bank has ""ample liquidity,"" but said that ""if everyone is telling each other SVB is in trouble, that would be a challenge."" SVB shares fell 60% on Thursday. This decline also weighed on regional banks, with the SPDR Regional Banking ETF (KRE) falling 8% while the SPDR Financial Sector ETF (XLF) fell some 4%. Among major U.S. money-center banks, shares of JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), and Wells Fargo (WFC) were all down more than 5% on Thursday. First Republic Bank (FRC), which maintains a large high net-worth clients business, saw shares fall 16% during Thursday's trading session. As Bloomberg's Jonathan Ferro tweeted, Thursday seems to have marked the moment in the rate-hiking cycle that higher rates are good for banks until they are no longer good. Earlier Thursday, labor market data had been the main catalyst for the market as investors await a crucial jobs report set for release Friday morning. The weekly report on initial filings for unemployment insurance Thursday morning showed 211,000 claims were filed last week, an increase of 21,000 from the prior weak and what economists at Oxford Economics called the ""first hint of weakness"" in this data. ""The jump in jobless claims to 211k last week from 190k is the first sign of weakness in the claims data this year but is still well short of the 300k+ level that would be consistent with a recession,"" Michael Pearce, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients. ""As the Fed presses ahead with more rate hikes, we expect layoffs to eventually rise significantly."" The initial pop from stocks following this data came after two days of testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made clear interest rates are likely to go higher than expected amid strong labor market and inflation data. Stocks finished Wednesday's trading session mixed after a sell-off Tuesday that was triggered by comments from Powell suggesting the Fed will need to raise rates higher than previously forecasted amid stubborn inflation. ""I was surprised by Powell's willingness to accelerate the policy tightening pace, but I am not surprised by the admission that terminal rates will need to rise further,"" said Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro. ""At present, the futures market is priced for a [50 basis point] move in March. There is no point cracking open a door if you don’t intend to walk through."" Data from the CME Group shows markets placing an 80% on the Fed raising rates by 0.50% later this month. Elsewhere in markets, WTI crude oil fell about 1.5% to trade near $75.50 a barrel, a retreat from the $80 a barrel oil was trading near earlier this week. Investors were also keeping a close eye on the Treasury market with the 10-year yield firmer by about 5 basis points, trading at 3.92% after a move higher in yields earlier this week led to a deepening inversion of the yield curve. In single-stock news, shares of Silvergate (SI) were in focus on Thursday after the bank said late Wednesday it would liquidate and wind down its operations after suffering heavy losses amid huge deposit outflows from its digital asset client base. Shares of Silvergate, which have lost more than 95% over the last year, fell 41% on Thursday. Other stocks on the move on Thursday included MongoDB (MDB), which fell 8.3% following a disappointing quarterly report. On the flip side, shares of Asana (ASAN) gained 19% Thursday after a surprisingly strong quarter.

2023-03-09,jnj,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/banks-tumble-svb-ignites-broader-173433069.html,"By Sinéad Carew (Reuters) - The S&P 500 bank index tumbled nearly 6% on Thursday in its biggest one-day drop in over two years as investors fled the industry following SVB Financial Group's share sale announcement and crypto bank Silvergate's decision to wind down operations. Shares of SVB, whose operating segments include Silicon Valley Bank, slumped over 50% in their deepest one-day drop on record after the company announced a $1.75 billion share sale late on Wednesday. SVB is battling cash burn due to declining deposits from startups struggling with a venture capital funding drought. San Francisco headquartered First Republic slumped 15% after hitting its lowest level since October 2020. The SPDR S&P regional banking ETF dropped more than 7% to its lowest level since January 2021. Major U.S. banks were also hit, with JPMorgan and Bank of America both down more than 5%. First Republic and SVB were the S&P 500's deepest percentage decliners in Thursday's trading session, while JPMorgan's loss weighed more than any other stock on the S&P 500's 1.1% decline at mid-day. ""The Silicon Valley raise got everybody nervous about people's capital levels and what deposits are doing. A lot of institutional investors don't feel great about owning certain banks right now,"" said R.J. Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. ""It just gets people freaked out because Silicon Valley, historically has been a very strong, well-run bank. If they're having issues right now, people are wondering what about other banks that are lesser quality and that don't have the reputation that Silicon Valley Bank has."" Investors were also grappling with the decline of cryptocurrency-focused lender Silvergate Capital, which dropped 22% after saying late on Thursday it planned to wind down operations and voluntarily liquidate after it was hit with losses following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. Shares in Silvergate peer Signature bank fell 9.4%.

2023-03-09,jnj,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/mortgage-rates-increase-again-flirt-with-7-170227323.html,"Mortgage rates surged higher this week, closing in on 7%, further cementing affordability concerns in the housing market. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage increased to 6.73% from 6.65% the week prior, according to Freddie Mac. Rates have climbed nearly three-quarters of a point since the beginning of February. The jump in rates continued to fuel the standoff between price-struck homebuyers and hesitant sellers, as elevated home prices weigh on already weak demand ahead of the spring season. Add to that the expectation that rates could soon crest 7% if inflation remains a top concern. “It's not just higher mortgage rates, but really the combination of higher mortgage rates and still higher home prices in most markets that are creating hurdles for buyers,” Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale, told Yahoo Finance. “Even though a greater share of home sellers in today's market have adjusted their price lower, both listing and sale prices have continued to climb on a year-over-year basis.” While the volume of applications to purchase a home increased by 7% for the week ending March 3, overall purchase activity was 42% lower than a year ago, the Mortgage Bankers Association latest survey found. “Even with this jump in activity, both purchase and refinance applications remain well below year-ago levels when rates were much lower,” MBA President and CEO Bob Broeksmit told Yahoo Finance. “The recent increase in mortgage rates, right at the start of the busy spring buying season, could cause prospective buyers to delay decisions until rates moderate.” Buyers still in the market also have to contend with higher list prices from sellers. The national median listing price increased to $415,000 in February, Realtor.com data showed, up from $406,000 the previous month and up 7.8% year over year. That reverses several months of softening listing prices after peaking in June at $449,000, and could suggest that sellers are getting stubborn in offering incentives. Without wiggle room on prices, buyers are seeing their purchasing power evaporate amid rising interest rates. For instance, the monthly mortgage payment for a median-priced home is 49% higher than a year ago at last week’s rate of 6.65%, according to Realtor.com. Buyers are likely to face further affordability challenges entering the spring, Hale noted, because too-low inventory will continue to buoy home prices. “One big reason that home prices continue to climb is that even though we have more homes for sale today, the market is still not back to what was common before the pandemic in most places,” Hale said. “And fewer homes for sale mean there's still some pressure on prices even though buyers are more selective amid higher costs.” As homebuyer demand remains weak, home sellers are feeling more pessimistic and are much less active than last year. There were 15.9% fewer homes listed for sale in February compared with last year, data from Realtor.com showed. Meanwhile, there’s some evidence that sellers are a bit less generous with buyer incentives. For instance, 57% of builders used incentives to close sales in February, the National Association of Home Builders said, down from 62% in December and 59% in November. A growing share of sellers are also pulling back on price reductions, more so than what is typical during this time of the year. According to Realtor.com, 13% of home sellers issued a price cut in February, up from 5.4% a year ago. Still, in January at least 15.3% of sellers lowered their prices to make a sale. Mortgage rates have been marching higher since February after government data revealed the inflation remains a threat. This week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell made it clear to Congress that he isn’t ready to soften his aggressive fight on inflation, indicating that further rate hikes would likely be necessary as we enter the spring. That could likely keep mortgage rates higher. Though “forecasting is far more art than science,” Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com, anticipates that mortgage rates are likely to climb higher before they retreat later this year. “At present, and while there is a chance that rates could retreat to recent bottom levels or perhaps a little below at some point, much depends on what happens with prices, with the Fed, and ultimately whether or not the economy gets to a tipping point and starts to head into recession,” Gumbinger recently told Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-09,jnj,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/9-ways-biden-is-set-to-raise-some-taxes-in-2024-budget-proposal-145357176.html,"President Biden is set to lay out vast and expensive ambitions in his 2024 budget Thursday from shoring up Medicare and boosting domestic spending to reducing the deficit by nearly $3 trillion over the coming decade. To pay for it all, he plans to propose a slate of tax increases, according to multiple peeks at the budget administration officials gave in recent days. There are new taxes on the business world focused on raising the rate on corporate income and on stock buybacks. He will also propose new taxes on wealthy Americans — from changes to how investment income is taxed to a revival of his ""billionaire minimum tax"" on wealth. “I want to make it clear I’m going to raise some taxes,” President Biden said during a recent stop in Virginia, offering one of his many previews of what's to come. Of course, presidential budget proposals are largely symbolic documents that are more about staking out a position rather than being enacted. But they serve as an important marker of Biden’s priorities for the year ahead. “What the president has really here to use is the bully pulpit, meaning once he puts his budget forward, is he going to continue to push some of those ideas?” asked Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget President Maya MacGuineas in a Yahoo Finance Live interview on Wednesday. “If he's serious about it, he'll push it.” Here are some of the new taxes set to be unveiled on Thursday In his budget, President Biden is set to renew his long-standing calls for more taxes on Corporate America. Included in a New York Times preview of the budget document are Biden’s desire to raise the corporate income tax rate to 28% from its current level of 21%. The president is also set to renew his call to quadruple the recently enacted excise tax on stock buybacks, a change he first offered earlier this year during his State of the Union address. On Jan. 1, a new 1% tax on share repurchases went into effect, but has done little to damp business enthusiasm for the practice. The provision is currently set to bring in about $74 billion over the coming decade, and Biden is proposing to increase the rate to 4%. And according to a document reviewed by Reuters, the budget will also propose scrapping tax breaks that oil and gas companies receive. That could likely open up another front in the back and forth between the White House and oil companies over record profits they've enjoyed since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The new proposals come after last year’s Inflation Reduction Act imposed multiple new taxes on businesses, including the 1% stock buyback excise tax and a new corporate book minimum tax. Going after more taxes so shortly after last year's victory likely will inflame critics. Erica York, a senior economist at the Tax Foundation, argued in an interview Wednesday with Yahoo Finance that Biden’s policies were already “heading in the wrong direction and the president's budget is going to double down on that.” “I would say wait and see how it plays out before you double down or quadruple down on it,” she added. Biden is also set to propose new taxes on Americans making over $400,000 a year. The president rolled out his most controversial proposal during this year’s State of the Union with a potential new tax that would target wealth, not just income. “We have to reward work, not just wealth,” President Biden said in his speech. “No billionaire should be paying a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter.” According to a preview offered to Bloomberg, the president will lay out new details on that, including a call for a 25% minimum tax on households worth more than $100 million as well as an increase in the capital gains rate for wealthy Americans. Other tax ideas that were present in previous budgets are set to be revived for 2024, including ending the so-called carried-interest loophole and eliminating some tax breaks around real-estate profits. All told, the various increases would fund nearly $3 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade and also fund other Biden priorities. The deficit reduction will come in a budget that “achieves this while lowering costs for families, investing in America, and protecting programs Americans have paid into because it proposes tax reforms to ensure the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share, while cutting wasteful spending on special interests — interests like Big Oil and Big Pharma,” Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Wednesday. Finally, the White House previewed new taxes to shore up the Medicare program earlier this week. Biden will propose increases on payroll taxes on Americans making over $400,000 per year; closing loopholes that shields some “pass-through” income from Medicare taxes; and allowing Medicare to negotiate on a wider array of prescription drugs. Those provisions, which Biden reviewed in a New York Times op-ed on Tuesday, would extend the program through 2050. Critics have noted that many of these proposals would be untested ways to fund the health care program for retirees. York also noted that some of the rule changes around the net investment income tax would help Medicare's finances by diverting some money from the government’s general fund. “Of course that looks like you're strengthening Medicare, but you're creating a hole in the budget elsewhere,” she said, noting the plan also increases the net investment income tax from 3.8% to 5% and would therefore also bring in more money overall. Republicans have been promising for weeks that Biden’s proposals won’t see the light of day. This is hardly new — there's an old saying in Washington about budgets that “the president proposes and Congress disposes” — but it will nevertheless increase pressure on House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) to offer his own proposal in the coming months. MacGuineas, who previewed the dueling proposals, noted that the White House budget will likely focus on tax increases and the GOP plan will revolve around spending cuts. “Neither of them is realistic, and, frankly, neither of them is the right policy,” she said. “We need compromises on both.” Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.

After two days of grilling before Congress, investors have been reminded (again) that the Fed chief still sees inflation as a persistent, pernicious threat. Stocks and bonds took notice Wednesday, as both sold off amid surging short-term rates — leaving the major indices underwater for the week as of the close. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes,"" said Powell before the Senate. And with two weeks to go until the next Fed meeting, markets are now expecting exactly that. Bonds and derivatives are pricing in a more hawkish outcome — expecting the Fed to lift its benchmark rate 50 basis points instead of 25 basis points. Since Monday's settlement, the U.S. 2-year Treasury-Note yield has surged 18 basis points to 5.06% — the highest level since 2007. It also deepened its inversion over the 10-year yield, with the spread reaching negative 108 basis points (or -1.08 percentage points) — the highest since the early 1980s when Paul Volcker was the Fed chair fighting a similar battle over price inflation. Under normal conditions, interest rates of longer-term loans or bonds (the cost of money) are expected to be more expensive than their shorter-term counterparts, as risk is higher on the long end. But this changes when the Fed starts stamping out animal spirits, lifting short-term rates to restrict the creation of credit and eventually choke off growth. While the magnitude, or depth, of a yield curve inversion isn't necessarily predictive of a deeper, or longer recession, there are a host of other indicators in the bond market that are sounding alarm bells. Former bond trader and CEO of TheMacroCompass.com Alfonso Peccatiello recently joined Yahoo Finance Live to offer his insights. Peccatiello notes that the bond market expects the Fed to fight inflation and remain tight, with interest rates well over 5% a year from now. ""That cannot happen if a recession is unfolding. The Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates,"" he said. Essentially, the inflation-fighting credibility that Powell has earned in the markets comes with a cost — pushing expectations of Fed capitulation far beyond what occurs historically. ""The issue is — the tighter you keep borrowing conditions for the private sector, the higher you keep mortgage rates, the higher you keep corporate borrowing rates — the higher the chances you're going to freeze these credit markets and basically sleepwalk into an accident or, in general, accelerate a recession later on,"" said Peccatiello. But long before the Fed delivers relief in the form of cuts, Peccatiello expects stocks to suffer from an earnings recession, which, he says, ""isn't fully priced in."" (An earnings recession — marked by two consecutive quarterly declines in S&P 500 earnings — often, but not always precedes an economic recession.) Peccatiello believes the U.S. is already in an earnings recession, with stocks reflecting complacency. Nevertheless, he doesn't expect a disaster. He sees about 10% maximum downside risk in the S&P 500 down to the 3600 level, which is right around last year's lows. ""I don't think it's going to be much lower than that,"" he says, adding, ""[T]he stock market generally bottoms before earnings bottom."" The reason gets back to the Fed, which historically capitulates and slashes rates as earnings drop. The Fed rate cuts then get incorporated into better stock valuations, which eventually halt the decline in stock prices, Peccatiello added. ""[This] means the stock market can stop its decline and start slowly but surely moving into a new bull market.""

""We have not made any decision,"" he told the House Financial Services Committee, saying key reports on employment and inflation would govern any moves. The remarks came a day after he told the Senate Banking Committee that, ""we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes"" if the data supported it. That spurred traders to price in a higher chance of a 0.50% hike than a 0.25% increase later this month. “We're going to be looking at the totality of data,"" Powell said Wednesday during questioning from House members. ""We are not on a preset path,"" he added. Powell said the Fed wants to see the upcoming employment report Friday, along with key inflation reports on the consumer and producer price indexes, before making a judgment. On Wednesday, the Dow dropped 0.18%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.14%, and the Nasdaq rose 0.40%. When asked by Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D, Mass.) whether the Fed would pause interest rates to avoid a recession, the chairman called it a serious question and noted that he wouldn’t say yes or no. The Fed, he said, is not ""seeking a recession."" Powell also said the era of low interest rates is likely over. ""Now, we have the 10-year [Treasury yield] back close to 4%,"" said Powell. ""And I think, we need to be careful not to assume that these secular low, longer term rates, will continue indefinitely because it doesn't look likely now."" Democrats, including Democratic Ranking Member Maxine Waters (D, CA) asked him to comment on the prospect of a U.S. default if Congress is not able to raise the debt ceiling. Powell warned that the Fed can’t protect the economy from brinksmanship or a default. ""No one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the non-payment of the government's bills, let alone a debt default, which I don't think will happen, but no one should think we have the tools to protect against the effects of that,"" said Powell. When asked whether the Fed would accept a trillion-dollar coin to avoid a debt default, Powell said there are no rabbits to be pulled out of hats and that would be a ""rabbit coming out of a hat."" House Republicans expressed concerns about reviewing and potentially increasing capital requirements for banks. Patrick McHenry, the chairman of the House committee, questioned the motivation of a ""holistic review"" of these requirements from the Fed’s Vice Chair of Supervision Michael Barr, saying the Fed shouldn’t operate in the shadows when the regulation in question can have broad and significant economic effects. McHenry also accused the Fed of laying the groundwork for a new climate policy. ""The Fed needs to stick to its knitting,"" said McHenry. ""I agree there is concern for many that the Fed is picking up new needles and knitting partisan sweaters at such a precarious time for our economy here at home in the global economy. That would be a mistake."" Powell’s comments Wednesday were his last before the Fed’s policy meeting in two weeks.

2023-03-08,jnj,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-march-8-2023-124051164.html,"U.S. stocks finished mixed on Wednesday, following two job prints that showed the labor market remains tight amid sticky inflation. Wall Street also heard from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday morning. Powell continued to stress that ""no decision"" has been made on the size of the Fed's upcoming interest-rate increase at its March policy meeting. ""When say we will look at the totality of data, that will include these next reports. We will carefully analyze. Haven't made a decision on the March meeting. Larger point is that we are not on a preset path,"" said Powell during his second day of testimony before Congress. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended the day up 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined by 0.2%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added 0.4%. Bond yields inched higher alongside a stronger dollar. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked up to 3.98% Wednesday. U.S. stocks plummeted Tuesday after Powell said during his Senate Banking Committee testimony that interest rates may rise “higher” than previously expected as the Fed continues a persistent fight against inflation. Powell’s comments on Capitol Hill triggered a 1.5% selloff in equities, according to JP Morgan’s trading desk. Tuesday’s losses saw every sector lower, with financials and real estate logging the biggest declines for the day. Treasury yields were higher, with the 2-year yield tipping above 5%, while the spread between the 10-year and 2-year US Treasury yields inverted for the first time since September 1981. According to strategists at Deutsche Bank, reaching this level signals a recession could be underway or has occurred within a maximum of eight months. “Powell’s speech indicates that the Fed will heavily depend on near-term data for upcoming rates decisions,” Michael Feroli, Chief U.S. Economist at JP Morgan, wrote in a note Wednesday morning. ""With January’s macro data mostly printing on the hawkish side, NFP Friday and CPI next Tuesday are the most critical catalysts for Fed’s decision between 25bp and 50bp,” Feroli added. Still, on the economic data side, ADP’s monthly read on private payroll growth rose by 242,000 in February, above consensus expectations for 200,000. ADP also tracked pay growth for those workers who stayed in their position, which decelerated to 7.2% last month, the slowest pace of gains within in the last year. “There is a tradeoff in the labor market right now,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist, ADP, wrote in the press release. ""We're seeing robust hiring, which is good for the economy and workers, but pay growth is still quite elevated. The modest slowdown in pay increases, on its own, is unlikely to drive down inflation rapidly in the near term.” Meanwhile, the U.S. monthly international trade deficit increased to $68.3 billion in January, below the consensus deficit of $68.7 billion as imports increased more than exports, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the U.S. Census Bureau. Another highlight Wednesday morning was January’s report on the number of job openings, which fell to 10.82 million, down from the upwardly revised 11.2 million openings in the prior month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. The construction, leisure, hospitality, and finance industries showed significant pullbacks in job openings. ""While the January JOLTS report shows job openings are heading in the right direction for the Fed, the decline is far too modest to convince that labor market conditions are cooling enough to bring down inflation,"" Matthew Martin, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a statement following the release. February’s jobs report out on Friday will hold more clues about the strength of the economy. Economists expect 215,000 new jobs will be added to the economy, a slower pace than January’s blowout number of 517,000 job additions. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.4%. Another key point from the reading will be wage growth, with a 0.3% month-to-month bump in average hourly earnings anticipated and 4.7% over the last year. In single-stock moves, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) gained over 2% Wednesday after a regulatory filing revealed that Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway bought nearly 6 million shares of the oil company in recent days, raising its stake in the company to 200.2 million shares worth $12.2 billion. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD) shares rose 3% Wednesday after the security software provider reported fourth-quarter earnings that topped analysts' expectations and issued stronger guidance for the fiscal first quarter. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) dipped 3% as Berenberg analyst Adrian Yanoshik slashed his rating on the stock from buy to hold, citing ""based on misplaced fears of a price war – appears to have been accepted by the market,"" Yanoshik noted. Separately, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened an investigation into the Model Y SUV over a concern with its steering wheels. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-08,jnj,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/key-recession-indicator-yield-inversion-treasury-160255114.html,"The Treasury market is sending its sharpest warning about recession risks since 1981. On Tuesday, the difference in the yield on 2-year and 10-year Treasury notes further inverted, with the yield on the 10-year falling 103 basis points, or 1.03 percentage points, below the yield on the 2-year yield. This dynamic has preceded each of the last eight U.S. recessions. By this measure, the yield curve has been inverted since July of last year as investors bet aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve to combat inflation would tip the economy into recession. In an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled the central bank will likely be more aggressive than it previously forecast in raising interest rates this year as inflation proves stubborn and the labor market remains strong. ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,"" Powell told the Senate Banking Committee in prepared remarks. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes."" ""Although inflation has been moderating in recent months, the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy,"" Powell added. The Fed will announce its next policy decision on March 22, a statement that will also be accompanied by new projections on where Fed officials see interest rates headed over the rest of this year and the next two. Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients Tuesday that Powell ""opened the door for the central bank to accelerate the pace of rate hikes and raise the target range of the fed funds rate more than anticipated because of the recent hot data on job growth and inflation."" Sweet noted investors are now pricing in 100 basis points of additional rate hikes from the Fed this year, up from the 75 basis points previously expected by most economists. Data from the CME Group showed Wednesday morning markets are now pricing in a nearly 80% chance the Fed raises rates by 50 basis points, or 0.50%, at its meeting later this month. As Yahoo Finance's Brian Cheung noted last year, there is nothing about Treasury yields themselves, or the relationship between the yield at any two points along the curve, that signals recession. Rather, it is what yields imply about future interest rates — and in turn future economic growth — that offers worrying signs for investors. While it is hotly debated what, exactly, ""goes into"" the yield for any Treasury security, a simple axiom used by many investors says Treasury yields indicate what the expected average of the fed funds rate, or the Fed's benchmark interest rate, will be over a given time period. With the 2-year yield standing at around 5% as of Wednesday morning, this implies investors think the fed funds rate will be, on average, 5% over the next two years. Today, the fed funds rate stands at roughly 4.6%, as the Fed's target interest rate range is 4.5%-4.75% following its decision last month to raise rates an additional 25 basis points. Therefore, we can say investors are anticipating the Fed will raise rates to at least 5% and keep them there for two years, or raise rates above 5% for some period of time before cutting them such that the average Fed funds rate is 5%. Duke professor Campbell Harvey, who uncovered this ""recession indicator"" in the 1980s, told Bloomberg in an interview earlier this year he thinks the economy can avoid recession despite warnings coming from his work. In part, in Harvey's view, this is because market awareness of this indicator has lessened its potency as a predictive measure. Notably, Harvey's worked actually focused on the spread between the 3-month Treasury bill and the 10-year Treasury note as the most potent recession indicator, not the now-popular 2-year/10-year spread. The spread between these two tenors along the curve currently stands at minus 107 basis points, still a clear recession signal by Harvey's work.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. The retail business is simple — buy from wholesalers, sell to consumers, pocket the difference. In exchange for capturing this difference between the wholesale and retail cost of goods, retailers take on the financial risk of fronting money to one party while working to make it back and then some from another. At the scale of the U.S. consumer economy, the differences between an additional week in a quarter, an additional weekend in a month, or even an additional day in a year can be millions of dollars or more. And if the timing of a day or two can disrupt the financial fortunes of a business — meaning there can be just hours between profits and losses — then one can imagine the challenges faced by retailers during the supply chain disruptions that results from the pandemic. In 2021, the story was that retailers were unable to match consumer demand as the economy re-opened. In 2022, supply chains that got unstuck eventually left retailers with more stock than they needed. As 2023 gets underway, retailers are suggesting the balance may finally be just right. Sporting goods retailer Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) reported fourth quarter results Tuesday morning that impressed investors, with shares rising 11% after the company offered a full-year earnings forecast well above expectations. And driving this profit forecast were inventories that are in ""great shape"" ahead of the company's busy spring season. ""As planned, we continued to address targeted inventory overages, and as a result our inventory is in great shape as we start 2023. We couldn't be more excited about our spring assortment,"" said Lauren Hobart, president and CEO. Dick's CFO Navdeep Gupta added on a call with analysts Tuesday morning, ""We were chasing inventory last year amidst industry-wide supply chain disruptions. ...Compared to Q4 of 2019, a 38% increase in sales was well ahead of our 29% increase in inventory. Our inventory is healthy and well positioned."" Looking at economy-wide data, we can see inventory-to-sales levels are still depressed relative to pre-pandemic levels. Though this measure is in part driven by strong sales, which keeps the ratio of inventories to sales low. Still, comments from Dick's were the latest echo of a refrain heard often from the industry as retail results have poured in over the last few weeks. And that refrain says the industry is finally finding something like a ""normal"" setting after three pandemic-altered years. Back in late February, Walmart (WMT) CEO Doug McMillon said his team, ""acted quickly and aggressively to address the inventory and cost challenges we faced last year."" ""We ended the quarter with inventory about flat to last year which is better than we anticipated and even better when you consider how inflation lifts that number,"" McMillon added on a call with analysts. ""And [we] did it while improving in-stock levels."" McMillon added: ""And so as we look at where we are today with much better position around inventory...I feel like this year will be more of a normal environment for markdowns or certainly more normal than what it was last year."" The company did, however, say there was ""work to be done"" on its apparel inventory levels. But clothing retailers Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN) both indicated in their latest reports inventory levels continue to improve. ""Despite an increasingly volatile macroeconomic climate, through the ongoing execution of our Polaris strategy, we remained agile, pivoted to meet customer demand and elevated our approach to inventory management,” said Jeff Gennette, Macy's chairman and CEO. ""In the fourth quarter, we benefited from our disciplined inventory approach."" The company reported inventory levels that were down 3% from last year and said, ""Inventory productivity continues to be a focus for the company in 2023 and beyond."" Nordstrom, for its part, said inventory levels were down 15% from last year and at levels similar to those that prevailed in 2019, the last year before the pandemic. ""We took decisive actions to right-size our inventory as we entered the new year, positioning us for greater agility amidst continuing macroeconomic uncertainty,"" said CEO Erik Nordstrom.

""Fed Chair Jerome Powell confirmed today that interest rates are set to rise higher than we previously anticipated,"" wrote Andrew Hunter, deputy chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. ""But with most evidence still pointing to economic weakness and markedly lower inflation this year, we still believe the Fed will begin cutting rates again sooner than markets are expecting."" Powell delivered the first of his two days of semi-annual testimony to Congress on Tuesday, speaking before the Senate Banking Committee ahead of Wednesday's appearance before the House Financial Services Committee. In his prepared testimony released Tuesday, Powell spoke of a sustained central bank campaign to rein in inflation. ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,"" Powell said. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes."" Answering questions from lawmakers, Powell said the full impacts of the Fed's interest rate increases haven't yet been felt in the economy. Markets have begun to price in at least two additional 0.25% rate hikes from the central bank over its next two meetings; investors began the year with optimism the Fed would stop its rate-hiking campaign as soon as February. Powell's comments Tuesday opened the door to the possibility of both a higher terminal federal funds rate, as well as a higher pace of increases. According to data from CME Group, Powell's comments spurred traders to price in a higher chance of a 0.50% hike than a 0.25% increase later this month.

U.S. stocks were trading lower Tuesday as some analysts said the comments were more hawkish than expected. Near 2:20 p.m. ET, the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) was near session lows, falling 1.5%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) off 1.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) falling 1.2%. ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,"" Powell told the Senate Banking Committee in prepared remarks.

""Although inflation has been moderating in recent months, the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy,"" Powell added. The latest Consumer Price Index report released last month showed prices rose 6.4% over the prior year in January, a slowdown from last summer's peak inflation rate of 9.1% but still well above the Fed's 2% target. Powell's comments spurred traders to price in a higher chance of a 0.50% hike than a 0.25% increase later this month, according to data from CME Group. In a note, Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner said Powell’s remarks ""opened the door"" to a return of 0.50% hikes, ""If the incoming data flow warrants it."" If there are ""upside surprises"" in a jobs report this Friday from the Labor Department, that could ""drive a faster and longer tightening cycle,"" according to Zentner's note. The Fed projected at its December policy meeting interest rates would need to rise to a range of 5%-5.25% this year, though Powell's comments now suggest rates will need to eventually rise above this level. Following the Fed's February policy decision, the central bank's benchmark interest rate stands in a range of 4.5%-4.75%. Some Senate Democrats challenged Powell during Tuesday’s hearing, cautioning that his rate hikes could lead to job losses. Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown (D-OH) said there are other ways to bring down prices, citing the strengthening of supply chains, boosting of U.S. manufacturing and the rebuilding of infrastructure. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said if the central bank raises rates as much as planned, to 5%-5.25% excluding any further rate hikes Powell has now suggested above that level, unemployment would rise to 4.6%. That, she said, would cost two million people jobs. ""Chair Powell, if you could speak directly to the two million hardworking people who have decent jobs today, who you're planning to get fired over the next year, what would you say to them?"" Warren asked. Powell, in response, said: ""I would explain to people more broadly that inflation is extremely high and it's hurting the working people of this country badly. All of them, not just two million of them, but all of them are suffering under high inflation, and we are taking the only measures we have to bring inflation down."" In a hat tip to these concerns, Powell said in his prepared remarks that the Fed is ""acutely aware"" high inflation is causing ""significant hardship"" for Americans while also pledging to “stay the course until the job is done."" The Fed chair said Tuesday policymakers will continue to make decisions on a meeting by meeting basis. Powell noted that economic data from January on inflation, job growth, consumer spending, and manufacturing production have partly reversed course from the slowdown seen back in December. Powell attributed some of the softening to unseasonably warm weather in January, but cautioned that the ""breadth of the reversal"" suggests inflation is running higher than expected. He reiterated the Fed still needs to see a drop in services inflation excluding housing to bring inflation down, which is likely to require a weaker job market.

2023-03-07,jnj,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/heres-what-biden-wants-to-do-to-shore-up-medicare-135302609.html,"President Biden is set to formally release his 2024 budget proposal later this week and is already offering previews on what he plans to do with Medicare. In new details released Tuesday to keep the program afloat into the 2050s, Biden says he can extend the solvency of the program without any benefit cuts via three moves: an increase on the tax rate on both earned and unearned income above $400,000; the closing of loopholes that shields some “pass-through” income from Medicare taxes; and allowing Medicare to negotiate on a wider array of prescription drugs. And overall, the president is looking at least five different tax changes for wealthy Americans and corporations to pay for his myriad ideas — both for Medicare and his larger push to “invest in America” and pay down the deficit. And while the proposal isn’t likely to get a vote on Capitol Hill, it will serve as an important marker of Biden’s priorities. The early focus on Medicare — as well as Social Security — underlines just how “deeply embedded” the twin programs have become in Biden’s political identity, Alex Lawson, the executive director of a group called Social Security Works, recently noted in an interview. The president talks nearly every week about the program and also released a New York Times op-ed on the topic Tuesday morning. Defending the programs now “seems to be one of the defining characteristics of Biden-world,” Lawson added. What the White House appears to be doing with this week’s choreographed multi-day rollout — culminating in a formal unveiling on Thursday in Philadelphia — is an attempt to shape the conversation as both the debt ceiling fight heats up this summer and a likely Biden 2024 re-election campaign kicks off. In the op-ed released Tuesday morning, President Biden wrote that “Medicare is more than a government program. It’s the rock-solid guarantee that Americans have counted on to be there for them when they retire."" The issue is top of mind with a key Medicare trust fund likely to run low on funds as early as 2028, according to a recent government trustees report. Meanwhile, Social Security likely has the funds to continue paying out current benefits for only a few years longer, through 2034. Biden’s proposal would increase the Medicare tax rate from 3.8% to 5% on all income above $400,000. It would also target what is known as net investment income - an additional fee on the returns for high-income earners as well as “pass through” business for Americans above $400,000 per year. The White House aims to change the rules and close loopholes around that income, which it notes can be shielded from the taxes that fund the Medicare program because it is classified currently as “neither earned income nor investment income.” The proposal would close loopholes in that area and also change the government's rules to allow that money to be sent to Medicare’s crucial Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, President of the American Action Forum, noted in a Yahoo Finance Live interview on Tuesday that the net investment tax piece is ""really using a tool that has never been used in Medicare before [and] it's not a particularly good piece of tax policy."" Holtz-Eakin, a Republican and former director of the Congressional Budget Office, added that the way to get these programs under control fiscally is to control growth, and ""you can't tax your way out of this."" The budget will also propose savings via new prescription drug reforms by giving Medicare the authority to negotiate prices for additional higher-cost drugs. The White House estimates these changes will save $200 billion over the coming decade. “There are ways in which the program can be operated more efficiently,” said Paul Van de Water, a Medicare specialist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who also listed other options for the years ahead like lowering payment rates to healthcare providers and limiting payments to Medicare Advantage. But even with all that, “it's still going to be essential we think to raise additional revenues,” he said. Van de Water also noted that Biden has previously proposed changes to the net investment income tax during a previous budget proposal. Thursday’s release will be Biden’s third since taking office. Tuesday’s unveiling is just the first step in what is much more detail to come about Biden's ideas and how he’ll pay for it all. In a recent online video, Biden’s budget director, Shalanda Young, outlined the overall priorities, including expanding the economy, lowering costs, protecting Social Security and Medicare as well as reducing the deficit by $2 trillion over the coming decade. So what other tax increases could be proposed? Administration officials say that both wealthy Americans and corporations will be the focus. In his State of the Union, Biden called to quadruple the excise tax on stock buybacks and to institute a new ""billionaire minimum tax"" on wealth. Both appear set for repeat appearances on Thursday. The president could also call to raise the top corporate tax rate, which would come in addition to a corporate minimum tax instituted last year as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. While House Republicans have pledged that all tax increases are off the table and won't be considered in the House. But the move will increase the pressure on Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) to release his own plan, something he has promised is coming soon. What Speaker McCarthy has discussed in the past is creating the “path” to balance the budget. House Republicans have already floated some small-scale proposals — targeting things like Medicaid and what they term as “woke waste.” What’s unclear — and Democrats and some budget experts charge is impossible — is how that plan takes a significant bite out of the deficit if Social Security, Medicare, and tax increases are all off the table. “We’re not going to sit here and be lectured by those folks about fiscal responsibility,” Biden said recently in a preview of the likely debate to come, adding of the GOP, it will “be interesting to see what they want to cut and what their numbers add up to.” This post has been updated.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. When Fed Chair Jay Powell settles in for his semi-annual testimony to the Senate Banking Committee today, investors will be looking for confirmation that the central bank is going to keep raising interest rates for the next several meetings to fight inflation. Besides the ongoing debate about whether the Fed’s actions are going to send the U.S. economy into recession and stocks into a tailspin, there’s been one other important side effect: the bond market is the hottest it’s been in years. That’s newly true not just for institutional investors, but for retail traders as well. That’s because online trading of Treasuries is accessible at a critical mass for the first time with rates at these levels. It's never been easier to buy, be it directly via the Treasury Department, from the discount brokerages, or through ETFs. The repricing of rate expectations this year has sent yields on many Treasury notes and bonds to their highest in 15 years, with the 2-year, 10-year (TNX), and 30-year all yielding around 4%. It’s been a huge shift for fixed income. Besides institutional investors salivating over government and corporate debt, retail traders are so keen they've repeatedly crashed the TreasuryDirect website, which provides a conduit to Treasuries and I bonds. (The latter is an inflation-protected instrument that has both a fixed rate and one that changes with inflation). “For pretty much the entire decade, leading up to this year, when people asked about retail and fixed income, I could just simply say, ‘no one really cares.’ The past year, that has significantly changed,” Shawn Cruz, Head Trading Strategist at TD Ameritrade, told Yahoo Finance. Sales of Treasury bills – those with maturities of one year or less – through TreasuryDirect were $12.0 billion in January, a record. Before last August, that number hadn’t cracked $5 billion. Net sales of I bonds were $4.2 billion in January, after spiking to $6.8 billion last October. Salim Ramji, Global Head of iShares and Index Investments at BlackRock, was enthusiastic about fixed income when he recently spoke to Yahoo Finance: “It’s a great time for investors to look for yield, but they don’t have to take the kind of risk that they might have two, three, four years ago, because you can get 4% yields in Treasuries. You can get 5% yields in investment grade, even at the front end.” BlackRock, as the largest provider of ETFs by assets, has benefited from the boom. Thus far in 2023, investors have poured $9.9 billion into U.S. iShares fixed income ETFs. And not all investors are going long; the firm’s most popular instrument in February in the category was the iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF (SHV). How long will the party last? Even if the Fed raises interest rates at its next three meetings, some strategists have called for a longer period of higher inflation and higher interest rates, an end to the so-called “Great Moderation.”  BlackRock predicts that fixed income ETF assets under management will reach $5 trillion by 2030. As Ramji said, “Having rates as low as they were for as long as they were was kind of the aberration. I think we’re resetting back now to a much more normal fixed income environment, and the great thing for investors, as a result, is they can use it to generate income, and so for retirees or people looking at their wealth portfolios, they’re able to generate good, long-term income from long-term investments like Treasuries or investment grade.” In other words, for a lot of retail investors right now, boring is beautiful. - Economy Wholesale Inventories, January Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before Senate Banking Committee Earnings Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS); Casey's General (CASY); CrowdStrike (CRWD); Manchester United (MANU); Sea Limited (SE); Stitch Fix (SFIX); Thor Industries (THO) Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"
2023-03-06,jnj,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-march-6-2023-123642397.html,"U.S. stocks lost steam Monday afternoon after rallying earlier in the session, kicking off a busy week on Wall Street with a mixed tone. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended the session near the flatline, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) increased 0.1%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) edged down 0.1%, reversing its gains from earlier in the trading session. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note hovered near 4% Monday afternoon, before settling at 3.98%. Crude oil traded higher, with U.S. benchmark WTI up at $80.55 a barrel. The dollar index moved lower trading at $104.34. U.S. stocks gained on Friday to close out a volatile week, while bond yields pulled back from their recent highs. The three major indexes rose for the week, with the Dow Jones adding 1.7%, the S&P 500 closing 1.9% higher, and the Nasdaq gaining 2.6%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury settled back below the key 4% level, and the two-year yield fell to 4.86%. Economic data released on Friday showed the services sector grew in February. This week, Wall Street will be paying close attention to the monthly jobs report out Friday. The February jobs report is expected to show 215,000 new jobs have been added to the economy, according to economist estimates, a slower pace from January’s blowout number of 517,000 job additions. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.4%. Another key point from the report will be wage growth, with a 0.3% month-to-month bump in average hourly earnings anticipated and 4.7% over the last year. Economists at Bank of America, led by Michael Gapen, believe a deceleration from January will be tied largely to weather shifts and a general mean-reverting nature of payrolls. ""Typically, when payroll growth records a sizable increase or decrease, we see a reversal in the following month,"" the firm noted. Also, investors will be keeping an eye on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's two-day biannual monetary policy testimony on Capitol Hill, which begins Tuesday. Other highlights this week include ADP’s monthly read on private payroll growth, January’s report on job openings from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Fed’s Beige Book. In single stock moves, Apple (AAPL) shares gained nearly 2% on Monday as Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng initiated coverage of Apple with a buy rating and a price target of $199. Ng noted Apple's success in hardware design and brand loyalty has led to a growing installed base of users that provide visibility into revenue growth. And Apple's valuation is attractive relative to its historical multiple and to peers. Ciena (CIEN) shares jumped 4% Monday after the company posted better than expected results that topped analysts expectations amid strong demand in its networking platforms business. Shares of BridgeBio Pharma (BBIO) surged more than 50% after the company topped Wall Street's expectations in a study of children with achondroplasia, a genetic condition that slows bone growth. Snap (SNAP) shares climbed 9% amid growing chatter that the U.S. could restrict — or ban — use of the TikTok app. Spirit Airlines (SAVE) shares tanked nearly 9% following reports that JetBlue Airways (JBLU) is bracing for turbulence from the Justice Department as it tries to block the airline's planned takeover of Spirit Airlines in the coming days, The Wall Street Journal reported. JetBlue shares finished up about 1%. On the earnings front, Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Oracle (ORCL) and BJ's Wholesale (BJ) are set to report results this week. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-06,jnj,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/as-airbnb-wins-back-wall-street-some-hosts-see-saturation-130755035.html,"Airbnb (ABNB) dazzled Wall Street with better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings results and forward guidance on February 14. ""We believe ADR [average daily rate] was the key upside surprise relative to investor expectations,"" Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni wrote about the company's Q1 guidance in a research note, ""which should help support more optimism around further upside on pricing and margin in the remaining three quarters [of 2023]."" Investors cheered the company's quarter by sending shares up 13% on February 15, the stock's biggest one-day increase since Airbnb's December 2020 IPO. On February 16, the stock logged its highest close since May 2022. Even after giving back some post-earnings gains, Airbnb stock is up about 45% from a record low reached at the end of 2022. But the sentiment shift came as something of a surprise to hosts and managers using the home-booking platform who say they are finding it harder and harder to book guests. Ric Kenworthy, who manages 96 short-rental property listings through a company, Old Town Rental, in Arizona, was scrambling to fill unbooked units ahead of last month's Super Bowl in Glendale. ""We ended up at, let's just assume midday Saturday before the Super Bowl, close to 90% booked for all of our properties,"" Kenworthy told Yahoo Finance, later adding: ""Some key markets are experiencing quite a bit of saturation."" Kenworthy said he ended up cutting his listing prices by 50%: The going-rate for one of his rental properties went for $450-$600 a night that weekend after he'd been anticipating a rate closer to $1,000 a night given the demand generally created by an event like the Super Bowl. ""In 2022, we saw new heights in demand on the Airbnb platform and the result is continued growth in typical Host income, which was over $14,000 in the US,"" Sam Randall, a representative for Airbnb, told Yahoo Finance in a statement. ""We continue to invest in the success of our Host community and in the coming months will release new pricing tools to help them set competitive prices."" While some Airbnb hosts may not be feeling the full benefits, there is little doubt travel demand is back in full swing. Despite sticky inflation, consumers are booking trips: Data from a Bank of America Institute survey shows money spent on airline travel per household jumped 3.5% in January while international spending also increased compared to two years ago. ""I think the psychological impact of being locked down for some portion of the pandemic has only accelerated the trend that had already started,"" Marriott International (MAR) CEO Anthony Capuano told Yahoo Finance Live after the company's fourth-quarter earnings results showed the average room rates up 13% and revenue earned per average room jumping 29% year over year. Airbnb posted revenue of $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter, better than analyst expectations for revenues of $1.86 billion. The company's earnings per share also topped estimates, coming in at $0.48 cents against $0.08 forecasted. On the company's earnings call, CEO Brian Chesky told analysts Airbnb experienced ""tremendous growth"" in units listed online, ending 2022 with 6.6 million active listings. That was 16% higher compared to the previous year. Chesky attributed the increase in supply to two factors: demand and systematic improvements to their platform. As people flocked back to traveling, nights and experiences booked increased 20% in the fourth quarter, with active bookers in the fourth quarter reaching a record for the company. ""[Annual] revenue of $8.4 billion grew 40% year-over-year,"" Chesky said on the earnings call. ""And when you exclude foreign exchange, our revenue increased by 46% year-over-year."" The average daily rate for an Airbnb accommodation grew 36% compared to 2019 levels, according to CFO David Stephenson. He noted that it's generally ""more expensive"" to stay at an Airbnb than other accommodations and projected rates would come down ""modestly"" through the end of this year. ""We're not seeing any major shifts in overall kind of utilization rate that give us any concern,"" Stephenson said. ""We feel like we continue to keep, in aggregate, this nice balance of growing supply and growing demand, and we want to keep that relative balance."" Airbnb also stressed that the company is focused on three strategic priorities: raising awareness of hosting, upgrading core services, and scaling services beyond its core offerings. In late 2022, Airbnb added short-term sublet listings in an effort to grow its footprint among the multifamily market. The company asserted landlords and property managers using the sublet service could earn about 20% of the booking revenue. Airbnb also rolled out new categories, including one called ""OMG,"" which captures the most unique and exclusive accommodations. And after a Wall Street Journal report highlighted how some travelers were frustrated with host-mandated chore lists and the app's pricing format leading to sneaky costs, Airbnb launched a feature to show users price totals that include cleaning, service, and other fees. Looking ahead, some wonder about the sustainability of Airbnb's boom. “Can the top line demand persist? And then given their growth and supply, can the average rates [hold]?,” Nick Jones, research analyst at JMP Securities, told Yahoo Finance. ""If the demand wanes, that's going to increase available supply at any given day, which then... should result in lower prices, which then would impact their profitability."" Even if demand plateaus, the situation could change: January data from AirDNA suggested that rapid listing growth ""outpaced rising demand"" in 2022. ""U.S. short-term rentals earned over $62 billion ($141 billion globally) throughout the year (up 25.1% YoY), with almost 200 million nights stayed and over two million listings receiving at least one booking,"" AirDNA stated. ""Overall occupancy ended the year at 58.7%, a significant drop from the 61.3% in 2021."" In any case, as travel evolves after the pandemic bust and boom, some Airbnb hosts see a shift in consumer behavior. Michelle Burson, owner of a 4,000 square-foot Airbnb in Brookings, Oregon, is experiencing less foot traffic for her rental unit. ""Our bookings [have] declined last year compared to the previous year,"" Burson said. In Burson's view, ""one of the reasons was people were taking their traditional vacations…going to Hawaii, Europe, rather than driving, [or taking] road trips."" And Masha Löfstedt, who owns three rental properties in Oregon, struggled to get her property booked ahead of the holiday season. ""One of our houses that rents out all the time, nobody's booked for this weekend. That's like the first time in years,"" Löfstedt told Yahoo Finance in late 2022.

While I really enjoyed watching Salesforce and C3.ai shares explode higher post earnings last week, hot movers along these lines have been too few and far between (in either direction) in recent weeks. But if you take a step back and level set the stock market today, the muted action kind of makes a great deal of sense. Investors are facing a fresh dilemma — call it paralysis by analysis amid all the incoming data flying in. On the one hand, we have hot retail sales and inflation reports from the government — both calling into question whether the Federal Reserve is moving fast enough to squash inflation. On the other end of the spectrum, the jobs market continues to be solid (as probably seen in this week's jobs report). Yet, when you look at fourth quarter earnings (and conference calls) from Best Buy, Home Depot, Target and other retailers, you will see consumer weakness in big ticket merchandise. Dig into Target's earnings, and you will see a shopper trading down to cheaper private label goods because they are less inflationary and they just got laid off by a tech company. Taken together, this is a confusing time to be an investor – something market maven Keith Lerner at Truist captures in a new note he sent me: ""The recent action is very much aligned with a key market dilemma we have been highlighting: If the economy stays stronger, as we have seen recently, Fed policy is set to remain tighter, and this will weigh on market valuations. Or, instead, if the economy weakens, this will pressure profits. Neither of these outcomes are favorable for premium market valuations."" In other words, Mr. Market doesn't know what he wants! And if you think all the bad news of any kind is priced into stocks, Lerner adds these considerations: ""For perspective, the S&P 500’s forward P/E of 17.6x is still slightly above the 10-year average of 17.2x, and that’s in the context of a high degree of uncertainty around economic growth, inflation, and earnings. Forward earnings estimates are hovering near a 52- week low, and downside risks remain. The 1-year U.S. Treasury yield has jumped above 5% for the first time since 2007, and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which is hovering around 4%, is nearly double the average of the past decade.""

2023-03-04,jnj,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/bankman-fried-flip-phone-limited-153437236.html,"By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sam Bankman-Fried should be allowed while on bail to have a flip phone with no internet capability and a basic laptop with limited functions, but be forbidden from using other electronic communication devices, the U.S. Department of Justice said. The proposal to limit the indicted FTX cryptocurrency exchange founder's communications was filed late on Friday in Manhattan federal court, on behalf of the government and Bankman-Fried's defense team. It requires approval by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who oversees the case. Kaplan had signaled at a Feb. 16 hearing that he might jail the 30-year-old Bankman-Fried for testing the limits of his $250 million bail package by communicating in ways that could not be monitored. The judge said he did not want to set Bankman-Fried ""loose in this garden of electronic devices,"" following accusations that Bankman-Fried tried to contact possible government witnesses and used a virtual private network to watch football. Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty after prosecutors said he stole billions of dollars of FTX customer funds to plug losses at his Alameda Research hedge fund. He faces 12 criminal charges under an indictment made public on Feb. 23. The proposed flip phone or other non-smartphone for Bankman-Fried would be limited to voice calls and SMS text messages. Laptop internet use would be restricted to specified virtual private networks, 23 websites for personal use including news, sports and food delivery, and websites to help Bankman-Fried prepare for his scheduled Oct. 2 trial. Bankman-Fried is living under house arrest with his parents, both Stanford Law School professors, in Palo Alto, California. The parents agreed to submit sworn affidavits that they would not bring other electronic devices into their home or let their son use theirs. They also agreed that each device would carry software that periodically takes videos or photos of the user, which court officers would be allowed to review, the letter said. Bankman-Fried's lawyers did not immediately respond on Saturday to requests for comment. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York and Anirudh Saligrama in Bengaluru; Editing by Daniel Wallis)"
2023-03-03,jnj,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-march-3-2023-133941006.html,"U.S. stocks rallied on Friday, rounding out a big end to the week, while bond yields retreated slightly from their recent march. At the close, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) surged 1.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) increased 1.1%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 2%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note (^TNX) moved back and forth around the key 4% level Friday, eventually settling below the line, after services data showed economic activity expanded in February. Crude oil traded higher, with U.S. benchmark WTI (CL=F) up at $79.71 a barrel. On the economic data side, economic activity in the services sector grew in February for the second consecutive month as the ISM Services PMI came in at 55.1, slightly lower from 55.2 recorded in January and above economist expectations of 54.5. February's ISM Services figures ""suggests activity continues to expand at a reasonably healthy pace, but provides further reason to doubt the idea that there has been a resurgence in growth since the start of the year,"" Andrew Hunter, deputy chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note following the release. The moves come after the Federal Reserve published a semiannual Monetary Policy Report to Congress that details the central bank's plans to hike interest rates as a means to restore price stability. Officials indicated ""that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2% over time,"" the Fed said in its report. Stocks rallied on Thursday, with the S&P 500 trading lower for most of the session before rallying after commentary from Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic. Bostic said he’s still open to raising rates by another quarter percentage point at the central bank’s March meeting. “I let the data guide me,” Bostic told reporters in a press briefing. “If the data continue to come in suggesting the economy is stronger than I had projected, I’ll adjust my policy trajectory.” Bostic, who isn’t a voter on monetary policy this year, wrote an essay on Wednesday calling for the Fed to raise its policy rate by 50 basis points to a range of 5%-5.25% and then keep it there until well into 2024. Fed officials raised the benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point in February, pulling the target to stand in a range of 4.5%-4.75%. Policymakers will be releasing new projections after the central bank’s March 21-22 meeting. In single stock moves, C3.ai (AI) shares surged over 30% Friday after the company posted fiscal third quarter revenue that came at $66.7 million, beating analyst expectations of $64.2 million. Shares of Rivian (RIVN) jumped after the EV maker said on Friday it's keeping to the original production forecast of 50,000 vehicles in 2023. Costco (COST) shares sank 2% after the bulk retailer posted mixed results for the second quarter. Total revenue for its latest quarter was $55.27 billion, slightly below analysts' expectations of $55.58 billion. During the earnings call, the company provided some hopeful news on the inflation front. ChargePoint (CHPT) shares were down Friday after the maker of EV charging stations reported disappointing results and issued softer guidance. Shares of Amazon (AMZN) were up 3% as the company pauses construction on its second quarters in Arlington, Virginia. The move follows the tech giant's announcements of job cuts in the wake of slowing consumer and corporate spending. Marvell Technology (MRVL) stock fell after the company reported mixed results, with earnings in line with expectations but guidance weaker than forecasted. Shares of Meta Platforms (META) surged 6% as the company announced it would slash prices of its Quest Pro virtual-reality headset after the product launch. In the cryptocurrency market, both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) fell as customers pull their funds from crypto bank Silvergate (SI), whose stock plunged more than 57% during the trading session on Thursday. Following the drop in Bitcoin, the pullback is close to 10% and the digital asset was on pace to close below its 50-day moving average for the first time in almost two months, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-02,jnj,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-today-march-2-2023-135533324.html,"Stocks rallied on Thursday with the Dow leading markets higher as results from Salesforce (CRM) lifted the index, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq shook off early losses to finish in the green. At the close on Thursday, the S&P 500 was up 0.76%, the Nasdaq higher by 0.73%, and the blue chip Dow up 1.05%. Rates remained a key focus for investors, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note settling north of 4%, its highest level since November. The rise in yields has come as investors brace for more aggressive action from the Federal Reserve in the coming months as inflation stays elevated and the economy remains strong. On the front end of the Treasury curve, the yield on 2-year notes continued to trade near its highest level since 2007. The 2-year yield, which stood near 4.8% on Thursday, is seen as the best proxy for investor expectations of the Fed's near-term path for interest rates. In single-stock moves, shares of Salesforce rose 11.5% on Thursday as investors cheered the company's latest quarterly report, which saw the embattled Dow member double down on cost-cutting initiatives and shareholder return plans. The stock's opening gap higher of 16% was its largest since Aug. 2020, according to data from Bloomberg. In an interview with Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi late Wednesday, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in reference to the company's efficiency initiatives: ""We have hit the hyper-space button."" The company announced in its quarterly report an increase in its share repurchase authorization to $20 billion, with COO Brian Millham telling investors on a call, ""We're inspecting every part of our business to find opportunities to drive efficiencies and reduce cost of sales, marketing, and G&A."" Salesforce's 11.5% jump, good for jsut over a $19 per share increase in the stock price, added roughly 110 points to the price-weighted Dow's 340 point gain on Thursday. Elsewhere in single-stock moves, shares of troubled bank Silvergate (SI) fell 57% on Thursday after the company delayed the filing of its annual report and said it would likely report losses larger than those previously disclosed. The bank took on several high-profile crypto clients in recent years and has seen its share price collapse by more than 90% in the wake of the failure of FTX, among other crypto bankruptcies. Tesla (TSLA) shares were also in focus on Thursday, falling 5.9% as the electric carmaker held its latest investor day on Wednesday, which revealed few new product details but emphasized the company's push to unlock new efficiencies in its manufacturing and design processes. On the economic data side, the weekly report on initial jobless claims showed 190,000 new filings for unemployment insurance were made last week, the latest sign the labor market remains robust.

2023-03-02,jnj,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/mortgage-rates-surge-closer-to-7-170022384.html,"Mortgage rates jumped higher this week, getting even closer to 7% and crushing homebuyer activity, which hit a 28-year low. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage increased to 6.65% from 6.50% the week prior, according to Freddie Mac. Rates have climbed over a half-point in February, reversing declines since mid-November. The spike in rates is another blow to would-be buyers, who are also facing still-high home prices and a shortage of affordable homes for sale. Sellers also appear to be pulling their listings, rather than cutting prices further to spur interest. “I think the biggest concern is buying into a market that would continue to go down,” Jeff Reynolds, broker at Compass and founder of UrbanCondoSpaces, recently told Yahoo Finance. “In my 18-year career, I have never seen rate moves like we are seeing now.” The volume of applications to purchase a home slid by 6% from one week earlier, the Mortgage Bankers Association’s survey of applications for the week ending Feb. 24 found. Overall, demand was 44% lower than the same week a year ago and has nosedived to a 28-year low. The drop in demand registered this past month is a sign that affordability remains a top concern, according to Redfin Deputy Chief Economist Taylor Marr. “The housing market took two steps forward in December and January, but has taken one step back in February,” Marr said in a statement. “Mortgage rates crept back this month, which is prompting more buyers and sellers to back off.” Another reason for the pullback in demand is rising home prices. The national median list price increased to $415,000 in February, Realtor.com data showed, up from $406,000 in January. While that’s down 7.6% from June’s peak of $449,000 – it still represents a yearly growth rate of 7.8%. That translates to out-of-pocket costs for buyers. According to Realtor.com, the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home is roughly $630 higher than a year ago. That puts the monthly mortgage payment 45.1% higher than a year ago, exceeding rent growth, up 2.9% from a year ago, and inflation, up 6.4%. As rates continue to climb, fewer home sellers are active this year. The number of newly-listed homes for sale declined by 15.9% in February compared with the previous year, Realtor.com data found. That’s a larger rate of decline versus January’s 10.4% decrease, but a small improvement from November and December. Overall, new listings remained 27% below pre-pandemic 2017 to 2019 levels. According to Redfin, existing homeowners don’t want to move because they don’t want to give up their ultra-low mortgage rates. As of February, approximately 85% of mortgage holders have a rate far below 6%. Homeowners may also be hesitant to put their homes on the market due to soft homebuyer demand that’s forcing sellers to cut prices. “We'll find out in the next 30 days if buyers are getting used to higher rates,” Reynolds said, “or if they will stay on the sideline waiting for rates to come back to earth.” Gabriella is a personal finance reporter at Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-02,jnj,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/what-the-end-of-the-great-moderation-era-means-for-investors-morning-brief-103057491.html,"This article first appeared in the Morning Brief. Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET. Subscribe Thursday, March 2, 2023 Today's newsletter is by Jared Blikre, a reporter focused on the markets on Yahoo Finance. Follow him on Twitter @SPYJared. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. In 2004, then-Fed chair Ben Bernanke gave a speech titled, ""The Great Moderation."" His thesis: ""One of the most striking features of the economic landscape over the past twenty years or so has been a substantial decline in macroeconomic volatility."" And while the Global Financial Crisis dented this belief, a post-crisis economic recovery and stock market boom brought these ideas back into vogue among many investors who rode a ""stocks only go up"" rally for more than a decade. But with inflation at multi-decade highs and interest rates at their highest levels in over 15 years, some investors are saying that the old investing epoch has come to an end — ushering in a new era where fundamentals matter, traditional savers are rewarded once again, and the volatility that Bernanke said goodbye to is back. In other words, choppier waters might be the new norm for a while. There are a few things that are starkly different about this present business cycle, Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, told Yahoo Finance Live Wednesday. First, there's the hot labor market, despite the white-collar layoffs. Historically, it's the lower-wage workers that are first in line to get cut. ""Yet another thing about this cycle that is just so different relative to past cycles,"" Saunders said. To date, this downturn has been felt mostly at the upper ends of the wealth spectrum, with asset prices like stocks, bonds, and real estate suffering declines. Meanwhile, inflation is a pernicious problem that disproportionately affects lower incomes. But it has not yet become entrenched — at least in the eyes of policy makers. Investors may not know what to think, but Sonders expects the current fog to lift a bit when we get the next batch of quarterly reports in April. But it might not be a clarity worth celebrating. Analysts have already been lowering the bar for the first quarter earnings, and Sonders believes they have a ways to go considering the bond market is signaling the Fed needs to be yet more aggressive. ""One of the factors most highly correlated to corporate earnings is the 10-year [U.S. Treasury] yield, with a lag,"" she says. Sonders believes the 10-year yield is forecasting the Fed will need to keep rates higher for longer, and that ""the path of least resistance for [earnings estimates] is down"" — targeting the first half of this year. Whether or not that near-term pain materializes, Sonders closes the door on the prior epoch of declining rates and volatility, then describes what investors can expect in the years to come. ""I think that the end of the Great Moderation era is very much here ... Gone are the days of cheap access to goods, cheap access to energy, [and] cheap access to labor. I think all three of those ships have sailed,"" she says. Sonders argues that reversing the engine of globalization and reorienting toward regionalism will have profound investing implications over the secular time frame. ""I would therefore expect greater inflation volatility, economic volatility, [and] geopolitical volatility. We're in this era of regionalization and demographic shifts that are pretty painful."" But as painful as these changes are for workers, consumers and investors alike, there are opportunities for investors. Consider that the Fed has finally raised short-term rates — the so-called risk-free rate — to levels that prevailed in decades prior. ""With the return of the risk-free [Treasury] rate, it's brought secular changes, including the fact that fundamentals are reattaching to prices,"" says Sonders. She goes on to explain that the market is no longer skewed so heavily toward mega cap stocks, and that there's hope for stock pickers once again after over a decade of underperformance. ""This has important implications and helps explain why equal-weighted [stock indices] have generally been doing better than [market] cap-weighted [indices] — why active [investing] has been doing better than passive [investing] — or at least is on a more level playing field with passive. And I think those are secular and as important backdrops for investors to think about.""

2023-03-02,jnj,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/silvergate-stock-crashes-after-company-delays-annual-report-reveals-new-losses-121923800.html,"Shares of troubled lender Silvergate (SI) fell 57% on Thursday after the company said late Wednesday it will miss a March 16 deadline to file its already-delayed annual report. The bank said its team ""requires additional time to perform analysis, record journal entries related to subsequent events and to complete management’s evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting."" ""The Company is currently analyzing certain regulatory and other inquiries and investigations that are pending with respect to the Company,"" the company added. Silvergate shares have collapsed over the last year as the company's entanglements with several crypto firms — including bankrupt exchange FTX, among others — resulted in deposits falling by more than two-thirds in the fourth quarter of last year. In January, the company laid off 40% of its staff. The company later suspended a dividend paid on preferred shares as it sought to shore up cash. Over the last year, shares of the bank have lost more than 95%. A spokesperson for Silvergate told Yahoo Finance: ""Silvergate is working diligently to file its 10-K as soon as possible and has no further comment at this time."" In Wednesday's notice, the bank said it sold additional debt securities beyond what was previously anticipated in January and February and it expects to record further losses than what was previously disclosed. In January, the company disclosed it took $887 million worth of non-interest losses in the fourth quarter. The sales are primarily to repay ""outstanding advances"" it received from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, Silvergate said. The bank also needs additional time to complete an ""evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting"" being conducted by its third party accounting firm. Citing business and regulatory challenges, the company is weighing how much the changes might affect its ""ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements,"" according to the filing. In late January, a bi-partisan group of U.S. Senators pressed the company to provide answers over whether it was aware its clients FTX misused customer funds. A Reuters report in February said a Silvergate account controlled by Binance.US moved millions of dollars to a company controlled by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. Last week in a joint statement with the Federal Deposit and Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve made a point to highlight the heightened liquidity risks for banks taking on crypto-related clients. As for its own risks, Silvergate cited “heightened regulatory scrutiny of banking institutions that provide products and services to the digital asset industry,"" private litigation, and investigations from congressional inquiries, banking regulators and the Justice Department. Analysts at JPMorgan downgraded the stock to Underweight from Neutral and withdrew their its price target in a note out Thursday, calling the situation ""highly unusual"" and adding: ""The 'run' experienced at Silvergate appears to have been driven by a combination of (1) trust in the overall system being shaken given the collapse of previously trusted players (such as FTX) and (2) short-sellers voicing concerns (primarily on Twitter).""

2023-03-01,jnj,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-march-1-2023-124448484.html,"U.S. stocks finished mostly lower Wednesday to start March as key manufacturing data offered mixed results and two Federal Reserve officials suggested a more aggressive rate-hiking campaign in the coming months. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) declined by 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was flat. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell by 0.6%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note moved upward and briefly touched 4% Wednesday. Crude oil traded higher, with U.S. benchmark WTI up at $77.73 a barrel. On the economic data side, U.S. manufacturing firms signaled a grim outlook for the sector, according to the latest PMI data from S&P Global. The seasonally adjusted S&P Global US Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index was revised lower to 47.3 in February, up from 46.9 in January. The reading indicates ""a solid deterioration in the health of the goods-producing sector, despite the pace of decline softening to the slowest for three months."" Separately, economic activity in the manufacturing sector diminished in February for the fourth consecutive month following a 28-month period of growth, according to the Institute for Supply Management report on business. The data offered a mixed bag. Employment in manufacturing decreased to 49.10 in February from 50.60 in January. New orders rose to 47.0 compared to January's figure of 42.5. Prices paid jumped to 51.3 from January's reading of 44.5. Stocks fell Tuesday, rounding out the last day of a volatile month of February on Wall Street. According to JP Morgan’s trading desk, February’s month-end rebalance drove some weakness in equities and strength in bonds Tuesday afternoon. With February in the rearview, the S&P 500 remains up more than 3% this year, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group. Mega-caps have been a massive driver of the index moves. That said, 20 of the largest stocks in the S&P 500 have accounted for most of the index’s gains. Now, as the calendar turns, March historically sees the S&P 500’s gains in the second half of the month, Bespoke Investment Group noted. The path of the Federal Reserve's rate hikes remains in focus for investors. Two Federal Reserve officials spoke on Wednesday leaned in the move that aggressive interest rate hikes are the path forward to ease inflation. They followed Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, who said on Tuesday it would be a “danger and a mistake for policy makers to rely too heavily on market reactions” and emphasized the importance to “supplement these traditional data with observations on the ground from the real economy.” However, Goolsbee, who will be a voter at this year’s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting, didn’t comment on monetary policy. Since last year, the Fed has sharply raised rates in an effort to cool inflation. But inflation remains sticky. Policymakers will be releasing new projections after the central bank’s March 21-22 meeting. On the housing front, mortgage rates continue to move upward, pushing buyers to the sidelines as the spring housing market is underway. Both purchase and refinance applications slumped last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index. Volume of purchase applications hit a 28-year low, down 44% from a year ago. Here are some of the tickers trending on Yahoo Finance today:  Eli Lilly and Company (LLY): The drugmaker announced Wednesday morning it expects to cap out-of-pocket cost of its insulin at $35 a month. The plan comes as a promise to provide critical relief to some people with diabetes, who at times face higher medical costs. Kohl's (KSS): Shares of the retail giant declined nearly 2% Wednesday after the company posted a surprise fourth-quarter loss and sales slumped as consumer habits shift away from discretionary spending. Wendy's (WEN): The fast-food chain announced in its quarterly earnings about its plans to target sales growth through 2025 as it streamlines costs. Rivian (RIVN): The electric truck manufacturer’s guidance for fiscal 2023 deliveries came in 20% below estimates as the EV maker struggles to scale up its truck, van, and SUV production. Nio (NIO): Another EV maker gave weak revenue guidance. The Chinese premium EV startup, reported a much worse-than-expected fourth-quarter loss as margins took a hit due to in part to ""losses on purchase commitments."" Novavax (NVAX): The vaccine maker warned of its ability to stay in business through next year. This comes as the company has struggled to develop and enter the COVID-19 vaccine market. Alibaba (BABA): The stock climbed in the wake of the group’s quarterly earnings, and fueled by the 4% surge in the Hang Seng index overnight. Dollar Tree (DLTR): The discount retailer stock rose nearly 2% after the company posted weaker guidance for the current fiscal year. Tesla (TSLA): The EV maker is set to kickoff its first Investor Day event on Wednesday from its gigafactory in Austin, Texas. CEO Elon Musk is expected to announce new Tesla products that aim to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and lead to a ""fully sustainable energy future."" HP (HPQ): The PC and printing giant's stock wavered after the company posted mix results amid a soft demand environment for personal computers. Fiscal-quarter sales dropped 18% year-over-year. Printer sales sank 5% from a year ago. Reata Pharmaceuticals (RETA): The stock surged nearly 200% Wednesday after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved the company's treatment for Friedreich’s ataxia, a rare inherited disease that causes damage to the nervous system. Lowe's (LOW): The home-improvement company reported weaker fiscal sales in the fourth quarter and issued a conservative outlook ahead, with comparable sales expected to be flat to down 2% compared to the prior year. The stock fell nearly 6% on Wednesday. Other earnings on tap Wednesday after the bell include Salesforce (CRM), Snowflake (SNOW), and Okta (OKTA). — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-01,jnj,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/goldman-sachs-tries-to-reset-firm-culture-after-three-unusual-years-171038235.html,"Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon addressed negative headlines surrounding the bank's culture during the company's second-ever investor day on Tuesday. ""I hate the noise,"" Solomon said bluntly. ""I live in the same neighborhood as you all live in and I wish the noise was different."" Various media reports of mass partner exits, coupled with recent Wall Street chatter the bank has lost its way after the failure of its consumer banking project Marcus, have all contributed to unfavorable sentiment. And this coming after the company laid off some 3,200 workers positions, or a little over 6% of its headcount, in January after a challenging 2022. Solomon admitted mistakes were made, telling investors: ""I think we’ve accomplished a lot over the past few years. We got some things right, got some things wrong."" ""I read things in the paper that don’t match what’s happening inside the firm,"" Solomon continued, explaining there were fewer partner transitions in 2022 than any other year going back to 2014. ""The culture of Goldman Sachs is incredibly strong. ...We have an extraordinary group of people working incredibly hard,"" he said. ""We also recognize we've gone through a very unusual period over last 3 years — the pandemic was a very tough thing on a culture like ours."" Goldman Sachs shares, down about 5% over the past month, are trading relatively flat year-to-date — underperforming the S&P 500's 3% gain over that same time period. Solomon went on to note Goldman is a ""human business,"" explaining the firm has made conscious decisions to invest in its culture with leadership spending more time with partners throughout the year to help push a greater sense of community throughout the organization. ""We’re going to continue to invest in our culture. I think it's very good, [but] I do think we've had dramatic shifts,"" he said, once again referencing the pandemic which was quickly followed by an unfavorable macro environment. ""That created more noise, more grumbling than usual."" Overall, ""I feel good about the partnerships [and] the culture, but that doesn't mean we don't have to keep investing,"" he reiterated. Goldman saw a rough end to 2022 with profits down a whopping 69% in Q4 amid a serious decline in deal-making revenues, pressured by a weakening economic backdrop. Following Tuesday's presentation, analyst reaction appeared cautiously optimistic, although questions remain over the path to profitability for its consumer banking unit, otherwise known as platform solutions. Shares of Goldman fell about 4% on Tuesday as the company made its pitch to investors. ""Coming out of the conference, the buzz among investors was whether GS will grow the consumer businesses or sell parts of them. Our interpretation of management's commentary is that both options are on the table,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck wrote in a new note published on Wednesday. Graseck maintained her Equal Weight rating and reiterated a 12-month price target of $332 a share. Graseck added all three business segments, which also includes investment banking and trading along with wealth and asset management, ""have an opportunity to contribute to Y/Y EPS growth as GS targets growth opportunities and gets more efficient."" Goldman reported a net loss of $660 million in its platform solutions unit in the fourth quarter with a full-year net loss settling at $1.67 billion. The company blamed the decline on higher provisions for credit losses, but stressed on Tuesday: ""Profitability is not a strategy. It is a priority and the outcome of a strategy well executed."" Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala told clients Wednesday Goldman's profitability push seemed genuine, writing: ""While investors looking for instant gratification may have been disappointed, we believe that management is on the same page with shareholders in that it appreciates the need to further shrink its consumer exposure ""unlock value"" (specifically, card partnerships and point-of-sale lending)."" Poonawala maintained a Buy rating and reiterated a $384 price target on the stock. Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-01,jnj,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/feds-bostic-kashkari-call-for-higher-rates-after-concerning-inflation-jobs-data-150224928.html,"Two Federal Reserve officials speaking Wednesday said more aggressive interest rate hikes are likely necessary to slow inflation, as is the central bank keeping rates at elevated levels for some time. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said Wednesday he is remaining ""open-minded"" about whether the Fed should raise rates by 25 or 50 basis points at its next policy meeting on March 21-22. Markets currently expect a 25 basis point, or 0.25%, rate increase from the central bank. ""I’m open-minded about whether it's 25 or 50 basis points [at the next meeting],"" Kashkari said during a Q&A at a Sioux Falls Business CEO event. ""What's more important is what we signal in the dot plot."" The Fed will release a new set of economic forecasts and interest rate expectations alongside its March 22 policy statement. Kashkari said in December, he jotted down raising interest rates up to 5.4% and holding rates at that level for an extended period. ""At this point I haven't decided what my dot is, but I would lean towards continuing to raise further that I would continue to push up my policy path."" ""Given the data in the last month — higher inflation than we expected and a strong jobs report — these are concerning data points suggesting we're not making progress as quickly as we'd like,"" Kashkari said. ""At the same time shouldn't overreact to one month of data even if the data is troubling."" Kashkari is a voting member of the FOMC, the Fed committee that sets monetary policy, in 2023. Elsewhere, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said Wednesday he believes the Fed needs to raise its policy rate by 50 basis points, to a range of 5%-5.25%, and hold it at that level until well into 2024. ""We must determine when inflation is irrevocably moving lower,"" Bostic wrote in an essay published Wednesday. ""We're not there yet. That's why I think we need to raise the federal funds rate to between 5-5.25% and leave it there well into 2024. This will allow tighter policy to filter through the economy and ultimately bring aggregate supply and aggregate demand into better balance and thus lower inflation."" Bostic is not a voting member of the FOMC in 2023, but will be a voting member in 2024. Bostic said in order to consider reversing the course of monetary policy, he needs to see a better balance in the job market between labor supply and demand and see broad-based inflation narrow. Bostic noted about half of the goods in the CPI market basket still show inflation rates of 6% or higher. The Fed targets inflation that averages 2%. ""If we are going to get inflation back in the range of our target, the breadth of inflation will have to narrow considerably,"" Bostic wrote. ""When inflation is no longer top of mind, our mission will largely be accomplished. We are clearly not there yet. But I—and the Committee—are committed to doing all we can to ensure that we get there as soon as possible."" Both Bostic and Kashkari noted that while the increase in interest rates has slowed the housing and real estate sectors, they aren’t seeing many signs higher rates are really slowing down the rest of the economy. ""Business contacts tell us activity may well soften, but they don't anticipate a severe deterioration,"" Bostic wrote. ""When businesses think customers will buy less of their product or service in the near and medium term, then they will adjust hiring and investment plans accordingly."" Kashkari said the U.S is not in recession right now pointing to strong job growth, but said whether the Fed can avoid causing a recession with its interest rate hikes to fight inflation — a so-called soft-landing —remains an open question. ""The track record is not good at being able to slow down the economy this much without going a little too far and heading into recession,"" he said. ""[But] typically, when the central bank has caused a recession by raising interest rates, the bounce back can be very fast."" Kashkari said the dynamics in this economic cycle are different given families and states have strong balance sheets and supply chains are getting better. Both Fed officials said the cost of raising rates too much outweighs the costs of raising rates too little, adding the Fed must avoid a 1970s scenario in which the central bank cut rates too soon, causing inflation to re-surge and forcing the Volcker-led Fed to hike rates much higher to ultimately bring down inflation.

Follow him on Twitter @MylesUdland and on LinkedIn. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. U.S. consumers and the executives that Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon talks to have a lot in common — they feel good about today and worse about tomorrow. New data out from The Conference Board on Tuesday showed consumer confidence dipped in February, with the decline entirely driven by expectations. The Conference Board's index fell to 102.9 in February from 106 in January and 109 in December; December's reading was the highest since Sept. 2021. Underneath the surface of this decline, however, was another month where a strong labor market lifted consumers' current expectations while fears about the future loomed. ""The present situation index rose for a third straight month, underpinned by upbeat views on employment and business conditions,"" wrote Gurleen Chadha, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, in a note to clients on Tuesday. ""That index rose 1.7pts to 152.8. The differential between jobs 'plentiful' and jobs 'hard to get' rose to 41.5ppts, the highest since April 2022, indicating that current labor market conditions are still quite tight."" In January, the U.S. economy added a surprising 517,000 jobs while the unemployment rate stood at 3.4%. Meanwhile, speaking at Goldman's second-ever investor day on Tuesday, Solomon said the executives he spends his days speaking with are feeling better about a ""soft landing"" for the economy, but that inflation worries are ""hampering confidence."" ""When I talk to CEOs, they feel more uncertain about the course of inflation as we run through 2023, 2024. ...There's a real belief that inflation will be stickier and harder to moderate than markets now predict,"" Solomon said. The Conference Board's data shows consumers remain pleasantly surprised the soft labor market they'd braced for hasn't materialized just as executives fretting over recession remain similarly relieved. And yet both groups in their own way remain braced for some version of economic impact. It's just not clear that hasn't already happened. We're coming off a year in which the S&P 500 fell 19%, the price of gas in the U.S. hit $5 a gallon, and the inflation rate reached 9.1%. In less than a year, the Fed has raised interest rates 4.5%. The housing market got crushed. And the most popular investing strategy for those saving for retirement endured its worst year on record. All things that have improved in 2023. And if there's one theme that been pervasive in markets and the economy for some time now it's a sense from investors and consumers that the worst is yet to come. Economists at Wells Fargo said in a note consumer confidence data ""pours some cold water on the streak of strong economic data received to start the year."" Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, said Tuesday, ""if consumers drive the economy, the outlook for 2023 is bleak as the consumers expect that the worst is yet to come."" On Tuesday, The Conference Board's Expectations Index stood at 69.7, notable as any reading below 80 is typically consistent with recession, according to the report. This index, however, has been below 80 for 11 of the last 12 months. And we wait for the recession still. Solomon said there is typically a ""4 to 6 quarter lag before people reset their expectations."" The question, then, is in which direction do consumers and businesses need to reset expectations against those held today. And, once they do, will it already be too late?

2023-02-28,jnj,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-february-28-2023-120603661.html,"U.S. stocks fell Tuesday, rounding out the last day of a volatile month of February on Wall Street. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) edged lower by 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined 0.7%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ticked down by 0.1%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked up to 3.92% Tuesday afternoon. The U.S. benchmark WTI crude oil moved higher to trade around $76.94 a barrel. The dollar index was up, trading at $104.92. Stocks closed higher on Monday, fueling a temporary rebound from Wall Street's worst week of the year. All three indexes ended February in the red after an optimistic start to the year in January. Economic data released on Tuesday showed that retail inventories, excluding auto, rose 0.3%, higher than 0.1% expected by economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Meanwhile, wholesale inventories declined 0.4%, below consensus estimates of 0.1%. American consumers felt worse about the economy in February, the Confidence Board reported. The board's Consumer Confidence Index slumped to 102.9 from 106.0, below consensus estimates of 108.5,  Meanwhile, February Chicago PMI dipped to 43.6 from 44.3, also below consensus expectations. “Consumers and businesses are looking for ways to reduce expenses in anticipation of much weaker activity over the rest of the year. The drop in consumer confidence in February aligns with weaker business confidence readings as the Fed’s sharp increase in interest rates start to bite,"" Ben Ayers, Nationwide senior economist, wrote in a statement. Other data showed that home prices fell 0.5% in December, according to data from S&P Corelogic Case-Shiller Index. On a yearly basis, home prices rose 4.6%, lower than analysts' expectations of 4.8%. As inflation still remains sticky, Federal Reserve Governor Philip Jefferson on Monday shot down arguments for raising the central bank’s 2% inflation target and said he is under ""no illusion"" that it's going to be easy to get the inflation rate back down. This week, investors will remain focused on the retail sector. On Tuesday, earnings from Target (TGT) topped analysts' expectations as consumer spending continues to move away from discretionary categories. The retailer’s same-store sales grew by 0.7%, above estimates of a 1.74% decline. The stock rose about 1% on Tuesday. Data from Bespoke Investment Group showed that over the last week, 420 stocks have reported earnings and the percentage of companies lowering guidance is more than double the percentage raising guidance, signaling ""lots of trouble for these smaller-cap companies that report late in the season."" In other single stock moves, Zoom (ZM) shares rose after the company posted better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings, with earnings per share of $1.22 higher than estimates of 80 cents. Revenue came in at $1.12 billion. Occidental Petroleum (OXY) shares moved down on Tuesday after the oil and gas producer posted fourth-quarter results that came in below Wall Street expectations on revenue and earnings per share. Shares of Workday (WDAY) were up after the human-resources software company topped expectations with revenue of $1.65 billion, up 20% year-over-year, against estimates of $1.63 billion. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. Today the process opens for semiconductor companies to apply for a piece of the $39 billion grant money being allocated as part of the CHIPS and Science Act. But there's a catch: firms that win the funds may not be able to buy back stock – for a while, anyway. “We want to make sure that their money is being used to increase research and development in innovation and not to pad their bottom line or do buybacks,” said Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in an interview with Yahoo Finance. One could argue it’s the administration’s prerogative to decide how chipmakers that accept grants to build factories use that money. But the White House wants to go further, by boosting taxes on buybacks from their current 1%. In his State of the Union address earlier this month, President Joe Biden said that tax should be much higher: ""Corporations ought to do the right thing. That’s why I propose we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks and encourage long-term investments. They’ll still make considerable profit."" That proposal is what may have led Warren Buffett to weigh in on the hot-button issue in the Berkshire Hathaway CEO’s annual letter to investors: “When you are told that all repurchases are harmful to shareholders or to the country, or particularly beneficial to CEOs, you are listening to either an economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue (characters that are not mutually exclusive).” Even Buffett has a caveat, however: he says buybacks make sense only if they are made at “value-accretive prices,” i.e. when corporations don’t overpay. Taking a step back, corporations have a number of ways to spend their money, from building new plants to hiring people to research and development. They can also distribute the funds directly to shareholders by paying out dividends. Or they can repurchase shares, which has the effect of reducing overall share count, automatically increasing earnings per share. (In a simplified example, if a company makes $1 million in profit and has 50,000 shares outstanding, earnings per share are $20. If it buys back 10,000 of its shares, earnings per share go to $25, making an existing shareholder's stake more valuable.) And the numbers are a lot bigger than in the example above. Last year, U.S. companies announced a record $1.223 trillion of buybacks, according to data from EPFR TrimTabs. This year, it’s already running at $274.9 billion — heating up even after the 1% tax kicked in. Eliminating or restricting that tool, then, would be a big deal. Will it actually happen? In the case of companies accepting money as part of the CHIPS Act, it’s unclear whether they’ll be barred from doing buybacks at all, or just directly using the funding they’ve received. (Senator Elizabeth Warren and some of her colleagues in Congress want the participants to be barred from doing buybacks for 10 years). Secretary Raimondo said each case will be different, but the government will in theory have the ability to claw back money in the “most extreme cases” if companies do not comply with their agreements, whether that deals with buybacks or other stipulations. Investors in companies like Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) should take note, since they’re among the firms that have announced plans to build plants in the U.S. and are likely to apply for federal funding. As for whether a broader clampdown on buybacks is coming, policy analyst Ed Mills is skeptical. “Really, what this is about is setting up a strawman, as we get into debates about the debt ceiling,” Mills, a managing director at Raymond James, told Yahoo Finance in an interview. On the one hand, Republicans will fire up their rhetoric about getting the U.S. fiscal house in order. Democrats, led by President Biden, are likely to shoot back by saying Republicans aren’t willing to ask companies enacting big buybacks to pay more in taxes. “I don't think it happens, but I think it's going to be more part of the conversation than I think the market anticipates right now,” Mills said.

The Minneapolis-based retailer saw same-store sales increase by 0.7%, higher than Wall Street estimates of -1.74%. Similar to Walmart's (WMT) latest quarterly results, consumer spending at Target seemed to shift to essentials like food and away from categories like electronics, home, and apparel. Target shares jumped by more than 3.5% in pre-market trading after the report's release. Target CEO Brian Cornell said the team was pleased with the sales growth in what continues to be a ""very challenging environment."" Here's what Target reported, compared to Wall Street estimates, based on Bloomberg consensus data: Revenue: $31.40 billion versus $30.46 billion expected Adjusted earnings per share: $1.89 versus $1.48 expected Same-store sales: 0.7% versus -1.74% expected Brick & mortar same-store sales: up 1.9% versus -2.80% expected Cornell said having multiple category offerings, including food & beverage, in addition to beauty and household items served the retailer well this past quarter, Cornell said. ""Strength in Food & Beverage, Beauty and Household Essentials offset ongoing softness in discretionary categories. This performance highlights the benefit of our multi-category merchandise assortment, which drives relevance with our guests in any environment, and is a key reason we grew traffic every quarter last year."" Same-store sales beat estimates, up 0.7% compared to expectations of a decline of 1.74%. Same-store sales at physical locations also got a boost, up 1.9%, while digital sales dropped 3.6% in Q4. At the end of Q4, inventory was 3% lower than 2021. Meanwhile, in discretionary categories like electronics, home and apparel, inventory was nearly 13% lower than 2021, ""partially offset by higher inventory in frequency categories."" For full-year fiscal 2022 results, revenue grew by $3 billion, to $109 billion. Compared to 2019, revenue is up more than $30 billion. In the full-year, same-store sales increased 2.2%, while traffic was up 2.1%. Looking ahead to fiscal 2023, Cornell said the retailer is focused on it's long-term strategy and ""continued differentiation through affordability, assortment, ease and convenience"" as it competes with other retailers for consumers trading down. ""At the same time, we’re planning our business cautiously in the near term to ensure we remain agile and responsive to the current operating environment...as we plan for the year ahead, we will continue to make robust capital investments and pursue efficiency opportunities in support of our long-term growth."" For the first-quarter of 2023, the company expects a wide range for same-store sales, from a low-single digit decline to a low-single increase, and an operating income margin rate of 4-5%. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.50 to $1.90. For fiscal-year 2023, the company expects same-store sales to be the same, from low-single digit to a low-single increase, along with an operating income of more than $1 billion and adjusted EPS to range from $7.75 to $8.75. In the next 3 years, the company aims to move beyond its pre-pandemic operating income margin rate of 6%, and says it could possibly reach that goal as early as fiscal 2024, ""depending on the speed of recovery for the economy and consumer demand."" — Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-02-27,jnj,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-february-27-2023-130555308.html,"U.S. stocks rose on Monday, fueling a rebound from Wall Street's worst week of the year. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose by 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.2%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased by 0.6%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked down to 3.93% Monday. On the economic data side, new orders for manufactured durable goods in January plunged to 4.5%, the biggest drop since April 2020, the Census Bureau reported. The drop was more pronounced than economist estimates of 4.0%. ""The manufacturing sector will remain under pressure in the months ahead, but the details of January's report of durable goods orders and shipments suggest factory activity started the year on a better note than the headline figure would suggest,"" Lydia Boussour, EY Parthenon senior economist, wrote in a statement following the release. Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors’ index of pending home sales climbed 8.1% to 82.5 in January, sharply higher from the projected rise of 1.0% by Bloomberg economists, according to data the group released on Monday. On a yearly basis, however, pending transactions plunged by nearly 24%. ""The increase in the Pending Home Sales Index confirms that the US housing market has improved, or better put, has somewhat stabilized over the last several months due to lower mortgage interest rates,"" Raymond James chief economist Eugenio Aleman wrote in statement to Yahoo Finance. ""However, the recent increase in mortgage rates is probably going to inflict some more pain on the US housing market going forward."" Stocks closed out their worst week of 2023 on Friday after the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge showed it unexpectedly accelerated in January and consumer spending jumped. The “core” Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index – which excludes volatile food and energy components – showed prices climbed 0.6% in January and 4.7% from last year. The Commerce Department also reported consumer spending rose 1.8% last month from December, the largest increase in nearly two years. The survey’s results renewed anxiety among investors that the Fed would continue its aggressive tightening campaign against inflation. The drop in optimism pressured the major indexes, as the Dow Jones dropped 3% for its fourth consecutive losing week, while the S&P 500 shed 2.7% in its worst week since early December and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.3%. Data compiled by 22V Research has found that rising interest rates have increased the correlation between growth and value stocks to the highest level since at least 2005. This week, investors will remain keen on the retail sector, with earnings from Target (TGT) on deck before market open on Tuesday after Walmart (WMT) warned of cautious profit guidance for the year ahead. Home improvement retail giant Home Depot (HD) also had disappointing guidance for fiscal 2023. Elsewhere on the earnings calendar are results from Costco (COST), Macy's (M), Dollar Tree (DLTR), and Kohl's (KSS) to feature the retail side. Meanwhile, the share of companies topping analysts' expectations in the fourth quarter has been low compared to history. Data from FactSet showed that 68% of S&P 500 companies reported fourth quarter earnings that beat expectations, down from the five-year average of 77% and the 10-year average of 73%. In single stock moves, Seagen Inc. (SGEN) shares jumped Monday morning after a report from The Wall Street Journal said Pfizer (PFE) is in early-stage talks to acquire the cancer drugmaker company in what could be a multi-billion dollar deal. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK-B) stock rose following CEO Warren Buffett’s annual letter to shareholders, which offered readers a glimpse into his views on share buybacks, taxes, corporate accounting, and his sense of optimism about the economy. Shares of fuboTV (FUBO) sank after the sports-focused streaming service issued disappointing guidance in its fourth-quarter earnings report on Monday and disclosed that it had sold stock at a deeply discounted price. Fisker (FSR) shares jumped Monday after the electric vehicle startup announced its deliveries for its first vehicle, the Ocean SUV, would be completed by spring. Shares of Union Pacific (UNP) climbed after the largest freight operator announced its plans to name a new chief executive following pressure from activists to oust Lance Fritz from the job. Bath & Body Works (BBWI) shares fell after the company said in a letter to shareholders that the looming proxy battle is based on ""misguided"" motivations and would be detrimental to shareholders. The board made the decision to not appoint former Third Point co-chief investment officer Munib Islam. Elsewhere, in cryptocurrency news, Coinbase (COIN) said in a tweet that it will soon suspend trading for Binance's stablecoin, Binance USD, on March 13 at or around noon ET. The move comes after Paxos Trust disclosed it will stop creating the Binance-branded stablecoin, citing regulatory pressure. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. Salesforce is facing a defining moment in its 24-year history. Growth is slowing. Analysts are worried fundamentals will get worse before they get better as companies curtail tech spending amid a sluggish global economy. A fresh round of layoffs at Salesforce have just been uncorked....at a company that has only known aggressive hiring. Employees are questioning leadership at the tech titan. Co-CEO Bret Taylor is no longer co-CEO of Salesforce — instead he's off to launch an AI startup the serial entrepreneur tells me. Slack founder Stewart Butterfield, who stayed on when the company was acquired by Salesforce, is still founder...but no longer with the parent company. Salesforce co-founder Marc Benioff is back at the CEO helm, after attempting again to pullback from day to day duties (by delegating to a co-CEO) and focus more on his vast philanthropic ventures. To top it all off the company is staring down the barrel of five sharks in the field of activist money management: Elliott Management, Starboard Value, Inclusive Capital, ValueAct, and Third Point. This is an unprecedented activist versus public company battle, pros have told Yahoo Finance. How it ends is wildly unclear, but is a situation just as important as Wednesday's earnings report. ""While the involvement of five activist investors has likely been the primary driver of CRM stock of late, quarterly results probably still matter (though not as much as usual), and how those results are delivered may be more relevant than ever,"" said Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci. Below, Yahoo Finance breaks down this complicated situation at large-cap tech name Salesforce. The drama is high, and it could all be coming down to one final epic conclusion. What Yahoo Finance Is Watching: Salesforce Earnings What sources tell us is top of mind on the Street: How quickly are sales deteriorating inside of the broader tech pullback? What does the pipeline of future business look like? Does Marc Benioff acknowledge the activist situation? Are more layoffs needed? Consensus is that Salesforce warns on sales and earnings for 2023 – but how bad is it? The Vibe Among Wall Street Analysts Analysts are generally expecting a muted tone from Salesforce on earnings day. “For Benioff and Salesforce the actual quarter and FY24 take a back seat to the fluid activist situation which is happening at Salesforce with the Street's patience wearing thin after a head scratcher Slack deal and slowing growth/underachieving margins front and center.” -Wedbush analyst Dan Ives ""Key to the Q4 call is gaining clarity on the extent to which management will turn the dial up on non-GAAP operating margins, GAAP profitability, and any future share repurchases with the emergence of activist involvement in the stock."" -Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss What the Activists Want From Salesforce Sources tell Yahoo Finance that Starboard Value — led by veteran activist investor and Papa John's chairman Jeff Smith — has been disappointed in Salesforce’s expense management, but isn’t advocating for a sale of Slack. Other activists involved in the situation are keen to see a Slack sale even at a low price as a show of faith by management they will improve margins, sources say. Overall, we are told the activists are entrenched and want clear changes from Salesforce leadership. Key thing the activist pool wants: Higher profit margins Realistic 2023 guidance Clear succession plan from CEO co-founder Marc Benioff Like we said, this earnings report is a defining moment in the history of Salesforce.

2023-02-26,jnj,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stocks-under-pressure-retail-earnings-continue-what-to-know-this-week-142308388.html,"The 2023 stock market rally is under pressure. Inflation data last week that topped expectations — as well as a continued drop in optimism the Federal Reserve's rate hikes will end sooner rather than later — pressured the major indexes with the Dow logging a fourth-straight losing week and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq suffering their worst weeks of the year, losing 2.7% and 3.4%, respectively. The Dow endured its worst weekly performance since Sept. 2022. In the week ahead, investors will remain keyed in on the retail sector, with results from Target (TGT) in focus after rival Walmart (WMT) issued a warning on the state of U.S. consumers last week. On the economic data side, a crowded calendar of reports from the housing and manufacturing sectors — two areas of the economy which have most reflected the impact of policy tightening — is on tap along with a key measure of consumer confidence. On Friday, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index — the Fed's preferred assessment of how quickly prices are rising across the economy — showed prices rose 0.6% during the month of January and 5.4% over last year. On a ""core"" basis, which strips out volatile food and energy components, prices rose 0.6% for the month and at an annual clip of 4.7%. The week marked a turning point in sentiment around inflation expectations and the path forward for interest rates. The hotter-than-expected PCE index followed upside surprises to inflation this year from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and producer prices, which showed the largest increases in several months to start the year. ""The bear market rally that began in October from reasonable prices and low expectations has morphed into a speculative frenzy based on a Fed pause/pivot that isn't coming,"" Morgan Stanley's top strategist Mike Wilson said in a note to clients last week. Wilson's forecast sees the S&P 500 bottoming out at 3,000 this year. On Friday, the benchmark U.S. equity index closed at 3,970. ""Investor optimism had already been hit by a slow puncture this week but it's deflating more rapidly as the latest data indicates that the work in taming inflation is far from over,"" Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in a note. Standout economic data releases in the week ahead include the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index, ISM's manufacturing PMI, and The Conference Board's consumer confidence reading for February. On the corporate side, Target will release its fourth-quarter earnings results before market open on Tuesday with results from Costco (COST), Macy's (M), Dollar Tree (DLTR), and Kohl's (KSS) also featuring on the retail side. Last week, Walmart's CFO John David Rainey said the ""consumer is still very pressured, and if you look at economic indicators, balance sheets are running thinner and savings rates are declining relative to previous periods."" ""We expect Target's results will look similar to Walmart's, with better-than-expected sales, more gross margin pressure than predicted, and solid opex leverage in the store,"" Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe said in a note. Tarlowe warned, however, Target is not ""immune to consumer spending trends shifting to the more needs-based items and away from higher-priced and higher-margin discretionary categories."" Elsewhere on the earnings calendar, notable reports include Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Zoom Video (ZM), AMC Entertainment (AMC), Rivian Automotive (RIVN), and Dell (DELL) among others. — Monday: Durable Goods Orders, January Preliminary (-3.8% expected, 5.6% during prior month); Durables Excluding Transportation, January Preliminary (0.1% expected, -0.2% during prior month); Non-defense Capital Goods Orders Excluding Aircraft, January Preliminary (0.0% expected, -0.1% during prior month); Non-defense Capital Goods Shipments Excluding Aircraft, January Preliminary (-0.6% during prior month); Pending Home Sales, month-over-month, January (1.0% expected, 2.5% during prior month); Pending Home Sales NSA, year-over-year, January (-34.3% during prior month); Dallas Fed Manufacturing Activity, February (-9.10 expected, -8.4 during prior month) Tuesday: Advance Goods Trade Balance, January (-$91.0 billion expected, -$90.3 billion during prior month, revised to -$89.7 billion); Wholesale Inventories, month-over-month, January Preliminary (0.1% expected, 0.1% during previous month); Retail Inventories, month-over-month, January (0.5% during prior month); House Price Purchase Index, quarter-over-quarter, Q4 (0.1% during prior quarter); FHFA Housing Pricing Index, December (-0.1% during prior month); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City Composite, month-over-month, December (-0.54% during prior month); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City Composite, year-over-year, December (6.77% during prior month); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, year-over-year, December (7.69% during prior month); MNI Chicago PMI, February (44.3 during prior month); Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index, February (-11 during prior month); Conference Board Consumer Confidence, February (108.5 expected, 107.1 during prior month); Richmond Fed Business Conditions, February (-10 during prior month); Dallas Fed Services Activity, February (-15.0 during prior month) Wednesday: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Feb. 24 (-13.3% during prior week); S&P Global U.S. Manufacturing PMI, February Final (47.8 prior); Construction Spending, month-over-month, January (0.4% expected, -0.4% during prior month); ISM Manufacturing, February (47.9 expected, 47.4 during prior month); ISM Prices Paid, February (44.5 during prior month); ISM Employment, February (50.6 during prior month); ISM New Orders, February (42.5 during prior month); Wards Total Vehicle Sales, February (15.00 million, 15.74 million during prior month) Thursday: Unit Labor Costs, Q4 Final (2.5% expected, 3.0% during prior quarter); Nonfarm Productivity, Q4 Final (1.5% expected, 1.1% during prior quarter); Initial Jobless Claims, week ended Feb. 24 (TK expected, 192,000 during prior week); Continuing Claims, week ended Feb. 18 (1.654 million during prior week) Friday: S&P Global U.S. Services PMI, February Final (50.5 during prior month); S&P Global U.S. Services Composite PMI, February Final (50.2 during prior month); ISM Services Index, February (54.5 expected, 55.2 during prior month) — Monday: Groupon (GRPN), LendingTree (TREE), Li Auto (LI), Lordstown Motors (RIDE), Oak Street Health (OSH), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Workday (WDAY), Zoom Video (ZM) Tuesday: AMC Entertainment (AMC), AutoZone (AZO), Cracker Barrel (CBRL), Compass (COMP), Duolingo (DUOL), GoodRx (GDRX), HP (HP), J.M.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) sank 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) plopped more than 300 points, or 1%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid 1.7%. Friday marked the worst week for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq since December. U.S. Treasury yields scrambled higher following the reading. The 2-year note surged 12 basis points to 4.81% while the 10-year note gained 7 basis points to top 3.95%. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index — the Fed's preferred assessment of how quickly prices are rising across the economy — rose 0.6% in January and 5.4% from last year. On a ""core"" basis, which strips out volatile food and energy components, prices rose 0.6% for the month and 4.7% from last year. The report from the Commerce Department also showed that consumer spending rose 1.8% last month from December after falling the previous month. The numbers support recent indications inflation is not falling at the pace and extent investors have been hoping for, even as prices have stabilized from the peaks of the current inflation cycle. “First December CPI was revised higher, and now each reading for January surprised to the upside. Inflation’s like an old boyfriend or girlfriend that keeps showing up when you don’t want to see them,"" David Russell, Vice President of Market Intelligence at TradeStation said in a note. In individual stock moves, Block (SQ) rose 4.3% after the payments processor reported fourth-quarter financial results that saw profit and revenue top expectations. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) shares fell 1% after the media giant posted a big revenue loss for the final three months of the year. Boeing (BA) shares closed down 4.8% after the airline manufacturer said it paused deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner jets because of a documentation issue. Beyond Meat's (BYND) stock rallied 10% after better-than-expected earnings and CEO Ethan Brown said the company is seeing progress in its efforts to cut costs and manufacturing hurdles. Beleaguered used car retailer (CVNA) plunged 20.5% after reporting a net loss that was nine times wider in the fourth quarter. The bumpier-than-anticipated road to restoring price stability and strong economic data to start the year — nonfarm payrolls rose by 517,000 in January while retail sales surged 3% — have prompted investors to readjust expectations around the path forward for interest rates, putting a dent in the market's recent momentum. The S&P 500 snapped a four-day losing streak on Thursday as stocks closed higher. But earlier this week on Tuesday, stocks had their worst day of the year. ""Equity bulls and even Chair Powell have bragged about anchored expectations for inflation and how consumers and investors believe it is moving in the right direction,"" Morgan Stanley Chief Investment Officer Lisa Shalett said in a note earlier this week, noting that January's Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) raised questions about whether inflation progress is stalling. ""Given data crosscurrents, the central bank needs to tread carefully. Investors still wagering on a 'Fed put; or quick return to financial repression are apt to be wrong this time,"" Shalett said. ""Fed credibility is on the line, and it is likely to risk overshooting rather than quitting the inflation fight too early."" — Alexandra Semenova is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Fed Governor Philip Jefferson said they remain concerned about an inflation rate that remains well above the Fed's 2% year-over-year target. Mester reiterated that while inflation has moderated, the overall level remains too high. She noted recent research from the Cleveland Fed and a discussion paper that have suggested inflation could be more persistent than currently anticipated. “I see the risks to the inflation forecast as tilted to the upside and the costs of continued high inflation as being significant,” Mester said at the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum in New York. “So in my view, at this point, with the labor market still strong, the costs of undershooting on policy or prematurely loosening policy still outweigh the costs of overshooting.” The comments came as the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation – the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index – unexpectedly accelerated in January, rising 5.4% last month on an annual basis. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the inflation gage rose 4.7%, both marking pickups after several months of declines. On a monthly basis, the PCE index rose 0.6% in January compared with December. Core prices also rose 0.6% in January from the prior month, compared with December’s 0.4% increase. The numbers Friday came a week after the government released the Consumer Price Index, which showed a similar pickup in the inflation rate. The hot read on inflation hit markets on renewed rate hike fears, with the Dow Jones Industrial average tanking 336 points. ""By betting on a terminal rate above 5.35%, the market is effectively betting that the recent momentum in both growth and inflation will be sustained through the summer,"" Jefferies chief economist Aneta Markowska said. Mester, who does not vote on monetary policy decisions this year, told Bloomberg in an interview Friday morning that the latest inflation reading shows the Fed needs to keep raising interest rates but stopped short of suggesting it required a 50-basis-point rate hike at the next policy meeting in March. Mester said last week she wanted to raise the benchmark policy rate by 50 basis points at the last policy meeting to try to get to the peak rate faster, though she also didn't want to surprise markets. In a separate interview Friday morning with CNBC, Mester signaled her forecast in December to raise rates a bit above 5% hasn’t changed much. Speaking at the same Monetary Policy Forum on Friday, Boston Fed President Susan Collins said inflation is still too high and that the Fed has more work to do. “Inflation remains too high, and recent data …all reinforce my view that we have more work to do, to bring inflation down to the 2 percent target,” said Collins. “I anticipate further rate increases to reach a sufficiently restrictive level, then holding there for some, perhaps extended, time.” Also speaking at the conference, Jefferson said a limited supply of workers for jobs needed, which has pushed up wages, suggests inflation may cool slowly. “The ongoing imbalance between the supply and demand for labor, combined with the large share of labor costs in the services sector, suggests that high inflation may come down only slowly,” he said. Jefferson also said the forces driving inflation now are different that past inflationary episodes and therefore economic models won’t be as helpful to policymakers. Jefferson said the current situation is different because the pandemic created unprecedented disruptions to global supply chains and is having a long-lasting impact on the labor participation rate. “The inflationary forces impinging on the U.S. economy at present represent a complex mixture of temporary and more long-lasting elements that defy simple, parsimonious explanation,” he said. Jefferson says he thinks the Fed is addressing the spike in inflation proactively, unlike in the 1970s and has more credibility now.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. What's old may be new again for U.S. stock investors. The end of zero-interest rate policies (ZIRP) is likely to mark a shift in equity market favorites from long-leading technology names to sectors like energy, materials and housing — or what strategists at Bank of America deem part of ""the old economy."" ""Bear markets have historically resulted in leadership change, which suggests old economy sectors are likely the winners of this cycle,"" Savita Subramanian, BofA’s head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy said in a note earlier this week. With these components of the market depleted of capital over the past ten years as Big Tech was powered by free money, the ""pendulum is expected to swing back"" in their direction, Subramanian noted. Despite the big gains across January in these very stocks that were battered throughout 2022, investors have called the moves higher this year a bear market rally rather than the start of a new bull market. ""I think the stock market is in a protracted bear market,"" DoubleLine Capital founder and CEO Jeffrey Gundlach told Yahoo Finance Live in an interview Wednesday (video above), adding it began in the fourth quarter of 2021. ""[It's] very negative for the stock market when you have rising interest rates against these valuations, especially real interest rates,"" Gundlach said, adding a pause in the increase in real rates this fall was a catalyst for the recovery in risk assets. ""But it looks like real interest rates might start rising again."" Meanwhile on Sunday, Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson told clients in a not that the recent rally was ""a speculative frenzy"" based on false hopes for a pivot by the Federal Reserve. Equity markets are in the throes of a recent shift in the narrative for where interest rates will go, finally taking Fed officials at face value as they vow to lift their policy rate above 5% this year. Bank of America indicated its analysis of equity risk premium shows growth stocks were not pricing in recession risk and the expected higher-for-longer rate environment is projected to pressure long-duration growth stocks. Whatever the rest of the year holds for the U.S. stock market, signs have already emerged of an imminent change in leadership. Last year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average crushed the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite, for example, falling less than 10% in 2022 while the latter index wiped out more than one third of its value. As Yahoo Finance’s Jared Blikre pointed out, the Dow’s outperformance relative to the tech index was by far the biggest gap since the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. Goldman Sachs’s chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin warned in November that the ""exceptionalism of technology is arguably behind us. In 2022, the aggregate market capitalization of the current ""tetrad of largest stocks,"" as Goldman Sachs put it — Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) – fell to 18% from 22% the prior year. And those top four stocks lost an aggregate -25% compared to -13% for the remaining stocks in the index during the period. ""With the end of ZIRP, we see the pendulum swinging back to the old economy as prolonged underinvestment has led to supply issues in the old economy,"" Subramanian said. Bank of America itself raised metals to overweight, and is overweight energy, a testament to its confidence in the leadership transition.

If you want to see more best long-term growth stocks for strong returns, go directly to 5 Best Long-term Growth Stocks for Strong Returns. It is impossible to know the future. As such, it isn't possible to know stocks that will generate strong returns for sure. Nevertheless, there are leading companies that benefit from secular growth trends that could potentially generate substantial profits in the future. Leading companies have a lot of scale and competitive advantages. Some leading companies are tech giants that benefit from the increasing popularity of AI. Companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) own leading cloud infrastructure businesses that will likely realize more demand from AI processing as AI apps grow. Some leading companies benefit from increases in the broader market, which could increase demand for asset management services such as BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) and Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS). Some leading companies such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) could benefit from the metaverse trend if it achieves the potential that some bulls think it can in the future. For those of you interested, check out 10 Most Promising Metaverse Stocks to Buy. In the near term, things are uncertain as the economy is currently strong but inflation is higher than the U.S. central bank would like. As a result, the Federal Reserve will likely continue to raise interest rates further and this could slow economic growth. If economic growth slows too much, demand for many companies might weaken more than expected and the job market might weaken. On March 9, the S&P 500 fell 1.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined by 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite retreated 2% due to a steep drop in SVB Financial which pressured banking stocks and also the weekly report on initial filings for unemployment insurance showing 211,000 claims were filed last week, up 21,000 from the previous week. Given the near term uncertainty and considering one company might not do well in the long term for any number of reasons, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.

And the housing stock continues to age with 50% of U.S. homes over 41 years old, the oldest since World War II.

2023-03-10,jnj,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/zacks-industry-outlook-highlights-j-093809856.html,"Chicago, IL – March 10, 2023 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses J&J JNJ, Novo Nordisk NVO, AstraZeneca AZN, Novartis NVS and Sanofi SNY. Industry: Big Pharma Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2063360/5-large-drug-stocks-to-watch-as-sector-picks-up-in-2023 Fourth-quarter earnings were mixed for the large drugmakers, with most companies beating earnings estimates but missing on sales. Most large drugmakers issued conservative guidance for 2023, which suggests there might be upward revisions as the year progresses. After a pandemic-driven 2020 and 2021, the sector had a brutal 2022 with declining valuations of stocks and a slowing of new drug approvals. However, the sector is poised to be back on track. In 2023, even if the United States enters a recession, the sector is expected to perform well as demand for its products is not affected by a recession. Overall, innovation is likely to drive growth in the industry in 2023. M&A deals are also picking up, which shows growth. Among the large drugmakers, J&J, Novo Nordisk, AstraZeneca, Novartis and Sanofi are worth retaining in your portfolio. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry comprises some of the largest global companies that develop multi-million dollar drugs for a broad range of therapeutic areas like neuroscience, cardiovascular and metabolism, rare diseases, immunology, and oncology. Some of these companies also make vaccines, animal health, medical devices and consumer-related healthcare products. All these players invest millions of dollars in their product pipelines and line extensions of their already marketed drugs. Continuous innovation is a defining characteristic of pharma companies and these large drug makers are constantly investing in drug development and the discovery of new medicines. Regular mergers and acquisitions and collaboration deals are another key feature of large drug companies Innovation and Pipeline Success: For big drug makers, innovation in their pipeline is a competitive necessity and key to top-line growth. Pharma companies are constantly striving to ramp up innovation and spending a significantly high portion of their revenues on R&D.  Successful innovation and product line extensions in important therapeutic areas and strong clinical study results may act as important catalysts for these stocks. Aggressive M&A & Collaboration Activity:  The sector is characterized by aggressive M&A activity. Given that it takes several years and millions of dollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch, large pharmaceutical companies sitting on huge piles of cash regularly buy innovative small/mid-cap biotech companies to build out their pipelines. Also, the sloppy sales of mature drugs, dwindling in-house pipelines, government scrutiny of drug prices, and the emergence of big tech firms like Apple and Google in the healthcare industry whet the M&A appetite of large drug makers.The fast-growing and lucrative markets such as oncology and cell and gene therapy are likely to remain focus areas for M&A activities. Also, collaborations and partnerships with smaller companies are in full swing. The year 2023 has begun with some big acquisition announcements. Amgen’s offered to buy Horizon Therapeutics for$27.8 billion in December 2022. Pipeline Setbacks & Other Headwinds: The failure of key pipeline candidates in pivotal studies and regulatory and pipeline delays can be setbacks for large drug companies and significantly hurt their share prices. Other headwinds for the industry include pricing and competitive pressure, generic competition for blockbuster treatments and a slowdown in sales of some of the most high-profile older drugs. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: The pandemic hurt demand trends of physician-administered drugs of most companies. Though trends recovered in 2021, infection rates shot up significantly in the last quarter of 2021, with the rapid spread of the Omicron variant. In 2022, major waves of variants of concern emerged quickly, became dominant and were superseded by the next variant. There is still uncertainty surrounding the emergence of new variants and continued global surges. Higher interest rates, inflationary pressures from rising energy prices, significant economic volatility, supply chain pressure and the war in Europe are creating an uncertain macro environment and economic volatility. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry is a 12-stock group within the broader Medical sector.  The group’s Zacks Industry Rank is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #106, which places it in the top 42% of more than 250 Zacks industries.

Though trends recovered in 2021, infection rates shot up significantly in the last quarter of 2021, with the rapid spread of the Omicron variant. In 2022, major waves of variants of concern emerged quickly, became dominant and were superseded by the next variant. There is still uncertainty surrounding the emergence of new variants and continued global surges. Higher interest rates, inflationary pressures from rising energy prices, significant economic volatility, supply chain pressure and the war in Europe are creating an uncertain macro environment and economic volatility.

2023-03-08,jnj,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/protagonist-ptgx-positive-results-frontier-171905340.html,"Shares of Protagonist Therapeutics, Inc. PTGX surged 51.91% on Mar 7 after the company announced positive top line results from FRONTIER 1 study of the oral IL-23 receptor antagonist JNJ-2113 (formerly PN-235) in psoriasis in collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc., one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson JNJ. The randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study FRONTIER 1 phase IIb trial (NCT05223868) is evaluating the efficacy and safety of JNJ-2113 in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. It evaluated three once-daily dosages and two twice-daily dosages of JNJ-2113 taken orally. The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients achieving PASI-75 at 16 weeks. Data from the study showed that JNJ-2113 achieved the study's primary efficacy endpoint with a statistically significant greater proportion of patients who received JNJ-2113 achieving PASI-75 (a 75% improvement in skin lesions as measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) responses compared to placebo at week 16 in all five treatment groups. Protagonist expects that JNJ-2113 will progress into a phase III registrational study in plaque psoriasis on the strength of these data. JNJ-2113 was discovered by Protagonist and is being developed by Janssen Biotech, Inc., pursuant to the license and collaboration agreement between Protagonist and Janssen. Protagonist completed a phase I study of JNJ-2113 in healthy volunteers in October 2021. Janssen retains exclusive, worldwide rights to develop the compound in phase II and beyond as well as to commercialize compounds derived from the research conducted pursuant to the agreement against a broad range of indications. If JNJ-2113 advances into a phase III study and the study meets its primary goal, Protagonist is entitled to get milestone payments of $50 million and $115 million, respectively. In total, Protagonist remains eligible for up to $855 million in various milestone payments and tiered royalties based on worldwide net drug sales. Hence, the successful development of the candidate will be a big boost for the company. The company’s shares have lost 9.1% in the past year compared to the industry’s decline of 10.2%.   Image Source: Zacks Investment Research JNJ-2113 is currently being studied in multiple trials, also led by Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen. FRONTIER 2 is a long-term extension study of JNJ-2113 in adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis; the SUMMIT phase IIa study is assessing a delayed-release JNJ-2113 tablet versus placebo in adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and a phase I study of an immediate-release formulation of JNJ-2113 in healthy and adult Chinese participants is currently recruiting. Meanwhile, Protagonist’s lead candidate, rusfertide, a mimetic of the natural hormone hepcidin, is currently in phase III. The phase III VERIFY and phase II REVIVE studies of rusfertide in polycythemia vera are ongoing. Protagonist retains all worldwide development and commercialization rights to rusfertide.

2023-03-08,jnj,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/berkshire-hathaway-high-coke-warren-130000996.html,"It’s no secret that Warren Buffett has made billions from his investment in Coca-Cola (KO). UBS says 61% of millionaire collectors allocate up to 30% of their overall portfolio to this exclusive asset class Here's how much the average American 60-year-old holds in retirement savings — how does your nest egg compare? You could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and CVS (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis) His company Berkshire Hathaway has held Coca-Cola in its portfolio since the late ’80s. But other than having benefited from the beverage giant’s rising share price over the decades, Berkshire continues to collect dividends from the investment. And the amount might surprise you. Coca-Cola paid four quarterly dividends totaling $1.76 per share in 2022. Berkshire held 4,000,000 shares of Coca-Cola in 2022, allowing it to earn $704 million in dividends from the company. The figure caught the attention of Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, who tweeted “Berkshire Hathaway high on Coke.” The best part? With dividend investing, there’s no need to worry about the stock market’s ups and downs. The S&P 500 tumbled 19.4% in 2022, but investors who held high-quality dividend stocks in their portfolios still got paid. Coca-Cola isn’t the only company that Buffett collects dividends from. Here’s a look at three other Berkshire holdings that are distributing generous amounts of cash to investors. In an era where physical stores are under serious threat from online merchants, Kroger (KR) remains a brick-and-mortar beast. In 2022, the company’s same-store sales without fuel increased by 5.6%. The economy moves in cycles, but people always need to shop for food. As a result, Kroger can make money through our economy’s ups and downs. You can see Kroger’s resilience in its dividend history: the company has increased its payout to shareholders for 16 consecutive years. Paying a quarterly dividend of 26 cents per share, Kroger offers an annual yield of 2.3%. As of Dec. 31, 2022, Berkshire owned 50,000,000 shares of the company. Read more: Here's how much money the average middle-class American household makes — how do you stack up? With deeply entrenched positions in consumer health, pharmaceuticals and medical devices markets, healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has delivered consistent returns to investors throughout economic cycles. Many of the company’s consumer health brands — such as Tylenol, Band-Aid, and Listerine — are household names. In total, JNJ has 29 products each capable of generating over $1 billion in annual sales. Not only does Johnson & Johnson post recurring annual profits, but it also grows them consistently: Over the past 20 years, Johnson & Johnson’s adjusted earnings have increased at an average annual rate of 8%. The stock has been trending up for decades, all while returning an increasing amount of cash to shareholders. JNJ announced its 60th consecutive annual dividend increase last April and now yields 2.9%. At the end of December, Buffett’s company held 327,100 shares of JNJ. Berkshire also owned 315,400 shares of Procter & Gamble (PG) at the end of 2022 — a company with an even longer dividend growth track record than JNJ. P&G announced a 5% dividend increase in April 2022, marking its 66th consecutive annual payout increase. The stock currently offers an annual dividend yield of 2.6%. It’s easy to see why the company is able to maintain such a streak. P&G is a consumer staples giant with a portfolio of trusted brands like Bounty paper towels, Crest toothpaste, Gillette razor blades, and Tide detergent. These are products that households buy on a regular basis, regardless of what the economy is doing. While shares have slipped around 8% in 2023, they are still up 74% over the last five years.

2023-03-08,jnj,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/15-dividend-zombies-kings-longest-105047953.html,"In this article, we will discuss 15 dividend zombies and dividend kings with the longest dividend payouts. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Zombies and Kings With Longest Dividend Payouts.  Dividend zombies are companies with century-long dividend payouts, whereas dividend kings are companies that have raised their dividend payouts for 50 years or more. 2022 was a difficult year from an investing point of view due to high inflation and continuous changes in monetary policies. Despite this, dividend stocks recorded one of their best performances in the year, becoming top choices for investors. Considering investors’ inclination toward dividend stocks, companies in the US steadily raised their payouts last year. According to research conducted by FactSet, the MSCI World Index reported a 5.5% dividend growth in 2022. The report also mentioned that the index is likely to deliver a 3.8% growth this year as well. Various pieces of research have revealed that dividend stocks perform well during inflationary periods. In this regard, companies with strong dividend growth track records become favorable as they have the ability to generate stable income for investors. According to a report by Indexology, the S&P Dividend Growers Indices outperformed their benchmarks in the three periods when inflation was at its peak since 2006. The report also mentioned that the year-over-year dividend growth rate over the past 15 years ending August 2022 was 13.71%, compared with a 2.21% growth in the Consumer Price Index over the same time. Analysts are presenting a positive outlook for dividend investment this year as well. According to UBS, the S&P 500 dividends per share will grow by 1% this year, despite an expected 11% drop in earnings per share in a recessionary environment. The bank also noted that dividends per share could show a 20% growth over the next two years if the Federal Reserve successfully avoids recession. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are some of the popular dividend stocks that are grabbing investors' attention. In this article, we will discuss dividend zombies and dividend kings that hold the longest dividend payout track records. Photo by Viacheslav Bublyk on Unsplash Our Methodology: For this list, we selected companies that have paid dividends for over 100 years and also have strong dividend growth histories. Some of these companies are dividend kings, which means that they have raised their payouts for 50 years or more. We also considered the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, according to Insider Monkey's database for Q4 2022. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the consecutive years of dividend payments. Consecutive Years of Dividend Payments: 103   Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 61 The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a Georgia-based multinational company that specializes in the marketing and sales of a wide range of beverages. On February 16, the company declared a 4.5% hike in its quarterly dividend to $0.46 per share. This was the company's 61st consecutive year of dividend growth and has been paying dividends to shareholders for the past 103 years. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.05%, as of March 7. In addition to KO, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are some other dividend companies with long dividend growth streaks. In February, Morgan Stanley raised its price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $70 with an Overweight rating on the shares, highlighting the growth in the company's organic sales. At the end of Q4 2022, 58 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), worth $28.8 billion collectively. Among these hedge funds, Berkshire Hathaway was the company's largest stakeholder, owning 400 million shares. Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).” Consecutive Years of Dividend Payments: 107   Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 27 International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), also known as Big Blue, is a New York-based technology company that has operations in over 175 countries. In January, BMO Capital raised its price target on the stock to $155 with a Market Perform rating on the shares, appreciating the company's recent quarterly earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2022, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) reported revenue of $16.7 billion, which fell in line with its revenue during the same period last year. For FY22, the company's operating cash flow came in at $10.4 billion and its free cash flow amounted to $9.3 billion. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) holds one of the longest dividend payment records of 107 years. Moreover, it has raised its payouts for 27 years in a row. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $1.65 per share and has a dividend yield of 5.07%, as of March 7. At the end of Q4 2022, 43 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), up from 40 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of $1.23 billion. Consecutive Years of Dividend Payments: 120   Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 52 National Fuel Gas Company (NYSE:NFG) is an American diversified energy company, based in New York. In fiscal Q1 2023, the company posted revenue of $658.8 million, which showed a 20.5% growth from the same period last year. The company's operating cash flow came in at $327.3 million, up 91% from the prior-year period. National Fuel Gas Company (NYSE:NFG) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.475 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.27%, as of March 7. The company holds a 52-year streak of consistent dividend growth and has raised its payouts for consecutive 120 years. It is one of the dividend zombies with the longest dividend payouts on our list. At the end of Q4 2022, 30 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in National Fuel Gas Company (NYSE:NFG), compared with 29 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a consolidated value of nearly $230 million. With over 1.1 million shares, GAMCO Investors was the company's leading stakeholder in Q4. Consecutive Years of Dividend Payments: 121   Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 29 Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) is an American insurance company that provides personal property and casualty insurance services to its consumers. In February, Atlantic Equities raised its price target on the stock to $250 with an Overweight rating on the shares. The firm believes that the property and casualty sector is well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing higher interest rates. Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) holds one of the longest dividend payout records, paying uninterrupted dividends to shareholders for the past 121 years. The company also holds a 29-year streak of dividend growth. It offers a quarterly dividend of $0.83 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.60%, as recorded on March 7. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) reported revenue of $10.5 billion, which saw a 13.2% growth from the same period last year. The company's operating cash flow for the quarter came in at $2.65 billion and it paid $345 million to shareholders in dividends. The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) grew to 45 in Q4 2022, from 41 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $2.18 billion. Aristotle Capital Management mentioned Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “Our investment in Chubb began in the fourth quarter of 2015, shortly after ACE Limited announced it would acquire the Chubb Corporation, creating the largest global property and casualty insurance company by underwriting income. During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.” Consecutive Years of Dividend Payments: 122   Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 27 Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) is a New Jersey-based consumer goods company that deals in personal care and household products.

It has also been paying regular dividends to shareholders for the past 122 years, holding one of the longest dividend payment streaks. The company's shares boast a yield of 1.30%, as of March 7.

Consecutive Years of Dividend Payments: 123   Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 16 Another dividend stock holding the longest dividend payout record is Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), which is a Nebraska-based transport company.

Here is what the firm has to say: “Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is a large railroad company that carries freight across the western US and between Canada and Mexico. It transports a variety of industrial goods, raw materials and containerized freight between major US ports, industrial hubs and international gateways. The goods that Union Pacific and other railroads transport are fundamental inputs in the economy and are resilient to long-term trends in the business cycle. We believe Union Pacific offers a compelling investment opportunity as its substantial infrastructure investments, relative cost advantages, limited leverage and the essential nature of the products it delivers provides the company with what we believe is one of the widest moats in the transportation sector. We also like that Union Pacific has a shareholder-oriented management team that is focused on growing earnings while returning capital to shareholders.” Consecutive Years of Dividend Payments: 124   Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 51 PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) is a Dividend King, holding one of the longest dividend payout streaks of 124 years.

Here is what the firm has to say: “While commodities-exposed areas of the materials sector such as mining and steel fared well in the quarter, we tend to have less direct exposure to commodities across our portfolio. Holdings like paint and coating company PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) that use natural gas and oil related products as feedstock into their products faced sharp input cost escalation, driving meaningful margin compression, which was not well-received by investors. While negative in the short term, we remain confident that the company will be able to adjust pricing accordingly and recover margins over the medium term.” Consecutive Years of Dividend Payments: 128   Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 60 Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is an American multinational consumer goods company, based in New York.

The company offers defensive growth at a reasonable valuation, and we continue to see the potential for shares to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns over the next several years. Fourth Quarter results were disappointing. The company missed on gross margins, guided 2023 well below the Street, and took another large impairment charge on its portfolio of skin care brands. The price action on the day of the print (down 5%) was extreme and perhaps reflective of growing investor frustration that the company has failed to sustainably grow earnings over the past decade. We believe some of this “miss” was beyond the company’s control and that Colgate is on the road to delivering more predictable results. Organic growth remains strong and we expect it to start translating into earnings growth as execution improves, margins recover, and external pressures calm down…” (Click here to read the full text) Consecutive Years of Dividend Payments: 132   Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 66 An American multinational consumer goods company, The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) ranks seventh on our list of the stocks with the longest dividend payout record.

Here is what the firm has to say: “Let’s look at The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).” Consecutive Years of Dividend Payments: 138   Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 9 Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is an American multinational pharmaceutical company that specializes in medicines for a wide range of ailments.

The collective value of these stakes is over $5 billion. Baron Funds mentioned Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a large-cap pharmaceutical company. Shares increased on investor optimism about Lilly’s new product pipeline, which includes Mounjaro for diabetes and obesity and Donanemab for Alzheimer’s disease. We continue to think Lilly has a healthy base business with limited near-term patent expirations, a strong pipeline, and potential for significant margin expansion, which should translate to strong revenue and earnings growth over at least the next five years.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 Dividend Zombies and Kings With Longest Dividend Payouts.    Suggested articles: 15 Best Small Cap Stocks Ready to Explode 11 Most Profitable Pot Stocks Now 11 High Growth Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy Disclosure.

2023-03-08,jnj,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-100010149.html,"Chicago, IL – March 8, 2023 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Procter and Gamble PG, Johnson & Johnson JNJ and Abbott Labs ABT. Growth stocks have clearly led the market thus far in 2023, but will that continue? Several extremely high-quality value stocks have been selling off this year, offering investors an opportunity to buy at a discount. On Tuesday morning, in front of Congress, Jerome Powell stated he believed there may be more rate hikes in the future than the market is pricing in. As we saw last year, when rates rise, growth stocks get hit, and value stocks get bid. Is this year setting up like that again? Procter and Gamble, Johnson & Johnson and Abbott Labs, three of the most established corporations in the world, are on sale today. This reflects the fact that investors believe the next 12 months are going to be rosy for the economy. But if they are wrong it could be another bull run in value stocks. Procter and Gamble Procter and Gamble, founded in 1837, is a multinational branded consumer packaged goods company. Its products range from cleaning products and detergents to shampoo and cold relief medicine. Most Americans, and some 170 other countries probably have a medicine cabinet filled with Procter and Gamble Products. It has a long history of steady earnings growth and stock appreciation. So far this year PG stock is down -8%, as many investors have rotated out of value into growth. Many investors are hoping for a Fed pivot, and lower interest rates. But that thesis is looking shaky. Procter and Gamble was an outperformer for most of 2022, although it did deal with some volatility giving back much of its gains later in the year. But I would contend that this sell-off is an opportunity to buy shares. Sales growth for the current quarter is expected to be down marginally, -0.3% YoY, with the next quarter expecting a resumption of growth. Furthermore, while the current quarter earnings expectations have been revised lower over the last 90 days it has only been a very small revision while all the other time frames have been revised higher over the same period. If PG were able to eke out a slight beat on sales next quarter, it will very likely cause investors to buy back into the stock. Many of the products PG makes are non-discretionary, so even in the case of an economic slowdown or higher inflation, consumers will continue to purchase PG goods. Procter and Gamble currently trades at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 24x, which is in line with its five-year median of 24x. PG offers a dividend yield of 2.6%. It has raised its dividend an average of 6.5% annually over the last five years. Johnson and Johnson Johnson and Johnson is a deeply diversified pharmaceutical, medical devices, and consumer products company that was founded in 1886. JNJ’s brands include Tylenol, Nicorette, and Band-aid among many other notable names. Its pharmaceuticals range from psychological treatments to Covid vaccines, and MedTech does everything from stroke treatment to orthopedics. Johnson and Johnson stock has a long history of earnings growth, dividend growth, and price appreciation, returning an average of 10% annually over the last 30 years. So far this year, JNJ stock has struggled though, down -12.5% YTD. Johnson and Johnson is trading at a very reasonable valuation. At 14x one-year forward earnings it is below its 10-year median of 17x. Over the last 10 years the only time the valuation was lower was during the Covid pandemic low. JNJ offers a dividend yield of 2.9%, which it has raised an average of 6% annually over the last five years. JNJ, like PG, has had slight downgrades in the current quarter earnings expectations, although future timeframes are being upgraded. Additionally current quarter sales are still expecting slight growth, which will accelerate over the next few quarters. Because of the non-discretionary nature of JNJ products, the company should remain very robust though many different economic regimes. So, if investors are looking for some defensive allocations in their portfolio, I think JNJ fits the bill. Abbott Laboratories Abbott Laboratories is another company founded in the 1800s, with a long history of earnings growth, dividend growth, and consistent stock appreciation. Over the last 25 years ABT stock has provided an average annual return of 10%. Additionally, management has raised dividends an average of 14% annually over the last 5 years. Abbott Labs discovers, develops, manufactures, and sells health care products worldwide. It operates in four segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. Products sold by Abbott are critical in the treatment of many health issues ranging from glucose monitoring for diabetes, to heart pumps for cardiovascular disease treatment. Currently trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 23x, ABT stock is just below its five-year median of 24x. So far this year ABT stock is down -8.2%, and over the last two years is down -10%. This has all happened while both earnings and sales have increased 45% and 24% respectively over the two-year period.

2023-03-10,BTC-USD,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/svb-stock-halted-as-silicon-valley-bank-capital-raise-reportedly-fails-buyer-sought-145321831.html,"Shares of SVB Financial (SIVB), parent company of troubled lender Silicon Valley Bank, were halted early Friday amid reports the company's efforts to raise capital had failed with the company now seeking a buyer. SVB stock plummeted 68% during Friday's premarket trading session before the halt after dropping more than 60% through Thursday, closing at $106 per share. CNBC's David Faber reported early Friday SVB's planned capital raise announced earlier this week had not cleared the market, and that the firm was now seeking to sell itself. Turmoil for SVB began when the California based bank filed a surprise announcement of a $1.8 billion loss following a deposit outflow and plans to raise $2.25 billion by selling common and preferred stock. Silicon Valley Bank primarily serves startups and technology firms, which have been under pressure as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.  Silicon Valley’s CEO Greg Becker urged calm with venture capitalists Thursday in a call, according to The Information, and asked them not to withdraw money. Bloomberg reported that venture capitalists have urged portfolio companies to trim their exposure to the lender. Another California bank that serves cryptocurrency clients, Silvergate Capital, announced a “voluntary liquidation” Wednesday, the same day Silicon Valley Bank announced its ill-fated capital raise. Shares were also halted in Signature Bank (SBNY), a New York institution that serves some cryptocurrency clients, after its shares dropped more than 16%. First Republic Bank (FRC), which serves some companies in the venture world and also targets high-net worth clients from the tech industry, saw shares fall as much as 40% early Friday. Concerns about risks to other banks spread on Thursday as stocks of giant financial institutions tumbled. A major bank index fell by the most Thursday in nearly three years. Shares for JP Morgan Chase (JPM) fell 5.41% Thursday and shares were roughly flat during Friday's open. Shares of Bank of America (BAC) fell 6.20% Thursday and opened Friday down more than 2%. Citigroup (C) shares fell 4.20% Thursday and opened Friday down more than 1%. Shares of Goldman Sachs Group (GS) fell 7.20% Thursday and an additional 2% Friday. In a Friday morning note, Morgan Stanley analysts said they don’t anticipate this SVB Financial’s challenges will cripple other regional banks. “The funding pressures facing SIVB are highly idiosyncratic and should not be viewed as a read-across to other regional banks,” according to the note. “We do not believe there is a liquidity crunch facing the banking industry, and most banks in our coverage have ample access to liquidity.” David Hollerith is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-10,BTC-USD,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-today-live-updates-march-10-2023-123845899.html,"U.S. stock futures were mixed Friday morning ahead of a crucial jobs report that will provide another snapshot of the strength of the economy and provide further clues to the path of the Fed's rate-hiking campaign. Futures tied to the S&P 500 (^GSPC) were down 0.2% ahead of the open, while futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined 0.3%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) edged up by 0.1%. January’s job report blew past expectations, as the U.S. economy added more than half a million jobs and the unemployment rate dipped to 3.4%, a level not seen since 1969. But economists aren’t expecting another surprise for Friday’s February jobs print. Consensus estimates from economists are for job gains of 225,000, a slower pace from the January’s blowout number. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.4%. “Signs of slowing outnumber signs of strength, making the chance that last month was a fluke likely,” Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, wrote in a note Friday morning. “At the same time, labor demand continues strong, which suggests a significant drop is also unlikely. A return to the previous trend makes the most sense.” The Federal Reserve has been keeping a close eye on all fronts to the labor market as the central bank tries to cool down inflation. The Friday’s jobs print will show whether January’s hiring gain was an outlier or the start of economic acceleration. Another key point of focus will be wage growth — and whether or not the trend accelerated last month. Meanwhile, other recent data continues to show the economy remains resilient. Consumer spending surged in January, inflation stayed sticky, and business activity expanded in February. The accumulation of economic data, coupled with comments this week from Chair Jerome Powell, has sparked the debate on whether a 0.25% or 0.50% rate hike from the Fed is likely for its March meeting. However, recent events in the banking world have spurred other concerns for Fed officials as their monetary tightening policy induces stresses into the banking system. A major tech firm lender revealed it’s in deep trouble. Silicon Valley Bank’s (SIVB) share price tanked 60% on Thursday, wiping out $9.6 billion of market value after announcing it needs to raise $2.25 billion to offset a $1.8 billion loss on some bond sales. The sour sentiment has spread across markets as the KBW Bank index (^BKX) was down over 7%, while index members including Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) edged lower Friday morning in premarket trading. Elsewhere, in the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin (BTC) crumbled below $20,000 Friday amid liquidation of Silvergate Capital (SI) and regulatory pressures on the industry. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-10,BTC-USD,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/february-jobs-report-march-10-2023-124602371.html,"The February jobs report is expected to show a slowdown in job growth from the start of 2023 while reinforcing the U.S. labor market remains strong even in the face of stubbornly high inflation. Economists expect nonfarm payrolls grew by 225,000 last month with the unemployment rate expected to hold steady at 3.4%, according to data from Bloomberg. The BLS will release its latest jobs figures at 8:30 a.m. ET. Here are the key figures investors will be looking for in Friday's report compared to January's figures, according to data from Bloomberg: Nonfarm payrolls: +225,000 vs. +517,000 Unemployment rate: 3.4% vs. 3.4% Average hourly earnings, month-on-month: +0.3% vs. +0.3% Average hourly earnings, year-on-year: +4.7% vs. +4.4% Labor force participation rate: 62.4% vs. 62.4% Average weekly hours worked: 34.6 vs. 34.7 Investors will be paying particularly close attention to revisions to January's data released Friday morning, as investors saw the unexpectedly strong 517,000 jobs created to start the year as a potential outgrowth of seasonal adjustment factors or favorable weather. ""Given the potential impact of weather and seasonality effects in January there is the possibility of another shock last month, albeit mainly to the downside this time,"" wrote Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients earlier this month. Ashworth expects job gains in February will tally 200,000 just below consensus estimates. Friday's report also comes less than two weeks before the Federal Reserve's next policy meeting, with markets now expecting the central bank will raise interest rates by a more aggressive 0.50%. Fed Chair Jay Powell told lawmakers this week ""the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated."" Data from the CME Group shows markets pricing in an 60% of a 0.50% rate hike on March 22. An employment report that is in-line with expectations could clinch that more aggressive move later this month.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. For the last year, the Federal Reserve has tried to accomplish one goal, using one tool — lower inflation by raising interest rates. The result has been benchmark interest rates rising by 4.5% in a year and headline inflation falling from a peak of 9.1% in June to 6.4% as of January. As Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated in testimony on Capitol Hill this week, there is still work to be done for the Fed to achieve its goal. But over the last week, acute challenges at two banks have surfaced another issue now facing the Powell Fed. And that is the stability of the financial system. On Wednesday, Silvergate Capital (SI), which had become one of the crypto industry's biggest banking partners, announced it will liquidate and wind down operations after suffering significant deposit outflows from its digital asset clients. That same day, Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB), the preferred banking partner of the venture and startup worlds, announced it would take a $1.8 billion loss while liquidating its entire short-term securities book and raising $2.25 billion fresh capital. In a letter to investors, CEO Greg Becker assured investors the bank had ""ample liquidity,"" and said it took these actions ""because we expect continued higher interest rates, pressured public and private markets, and elevated cash burn levels from our clients as they invest in their businesses."" The Information reported Thursday afternoon Becker told investors on a call, ""I would ask everyone to stay calm and to support us just like we supported you during the challenging times."" Few statements have a tougher audience than investors being told to remain calm in times of market stress. On Thursday, U.S. stocks got crushed during a steady, relentless sell-off that centered on the financial sector. Regional banks were hammered. Big banks were hammered. The S&P 500 fell 1.8%. Bitcoin fell 7%. The challenge for Powell, however, is that some of the stress facing Silicon Valley Bank has been induced by the Fed's actions to fight inflation. And the fear is they may not be alone. In the simplest terms, Silicon Valley Bank took a nearly $2 billion hit selling bonds at a loss to buy different bonds that offer a higher yield. The firm's latest annual report showed the bank owned about $14 billion in Treasury securities with an average maturity between 1-5 years. Today, 1-year Treasury bills yield 5.25%. One day's drop in the stock market, of course, is not cause for concern about the financial system. Even the liquidation of one bank and deep investor concerns about another need not constitute a Fed-level worry about the U.S. banking system. But these moves serve as reminders that while the central bank's role in raising or lowering interest rates has become the focal point of investor attention over the last decade, the Fed also serves the central role in stabilizing markets and quelling investor fears during uncertain moments like the present. Almost exactly three years ago, Powell held an emergency Sunday night call on March 15, 2020 to announce a series of measures aimed at supporting the economy as the pandemic rapidly shut down global business. On that call, Powell reminded the assembled press, ""[That] central banks were originally designed to ...provide liquidity to financial systems in stress, so we take that job very seriously. It's probably the most important thing we're doing now is that."" Rising anxiety in the banking system as the ripples from a crypto collapse in 2022 and the icing over of a red hot venture market pale in comparison to the financial emergency the Fed faced three years ago. But their actions then were a reminder of the central bank's power, and, indeed, its centrality to financial markets. When the February jobs report is released Friday morning, investors will pore over the data to decipher whether a 0.25% or 0.50% rate hike from the Fed is likely warranted on March 22. This is the moment markets have been building towards for weeks. But the unforeseen stress now being injected into the banking system makes Friday and the days ahead notable for the Fed in an entirely different manner. That presents to Jay Powell another wrinkle in the challenge of trying to bring order to an economy that busted and boomed in a few short months.

2023-03-10,BTC-USD,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/why-silicon-valley-banks-crisis-is-rattling-americas-biggest-banks-121159393.html,"The problems of two small banks on the West Coast are rippling across markets and causing new investor concerns about some of the country’s largest financial institutions. Why? Three words: rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve’s aggressive campaign to bring down inflation helped set the stage for major problems at two California lending institutions — SVB Financial (SIVB) and Silvergate Capital (SI) — as an outflow of deposits forced both to sell assets at a loss. Those assets were bonds. Banks are big investors in assets like Treasury bills because they need lots of safe places to park their cash. Many financial institutions piled into these investments during a period of historically-low interest rates that spanned the early years of the pandemic, as banks took in tons of new deposits and lending was somewhat restrained. But now the Fed is hiking rates at a rapid clip, with Fed Chair Jay Powell warning earlier this week the central bank may have to speed up the pace of its rate increases to cool the economy further. The problem that creates for banks is simple: higher rates lower the value of their existing bonds. The withdrawals at SVB's Silicon Valley Bank have come from startups and technology firms, many of which also ran into new trouble once the Fed began raising rates. The deposit outflow forced SVB to sell assets and take a $1.8 billion loss, a move the bank it made “because we expect continued higher interest rates, pressured public and private markets, and elevated cash-burn levels from our clients as they invest in their businesses.” Its shares fell more than 60% Thursday. In pre-market trade on Friday SVB shares were down another 60% after overnight reporting from Bloomberg said VC firms ranging from Peter Thiel's Founder Fund to Union Square Ventures had told portfolio companies to pull their money from Silicon Valley Bank. Banks don't have to realize losses on bonds that may have gone down in value amid rising rates if they're not pushed to sell these assets. But Silvergate Capital and SVB Financial didn’t have that choice. Customer withdrawals at Silvergate Bank and SVB’s Silicon Valley Bank forced their hand. At Silvergate, which caters to cryptocurrency clients, customers yanked their money in the panic that followed the 2022 collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Silvergate said in January that it had realized losses of $886 million from selling securities as deposits fell. That weakened the bank considerably. On Wednesday it said it would wind down its bank, and its shares plunged Thursday. After disclosing the $1.8 billion loss and new capital raise, Silicon Valley’s CEO Greg Becker urged calm in a call with venture capitalists Thursday, according to The Information, asking these investors not to withdraw money. It now is seeking to raise $2.25 billion of new capital to cover the new losses. The concern now among investors is that much bigger banks could be forced to do the same. That sent the stocks of giant financial institutions tumbling Thursday, including the biggest of the big: JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC). A major bank index fell by the most Thursday in nearly three years. The biggest U.S. banks are much stronger than they were in the lead up to the last big banking crisis, in 2008, in part because regulators forced them to hold more capital and survive numerous stress test scenarios over the last decade and a half. And the giants have more diverse funding and customer bases than banks such as Silicon Valley or Silvergate, which gives them many more options during challenging times. Longtime banking analyst Mike Mayo said Thursday during an appearance on CNBC the biggest banks are ""a pillar of strength and stability"" and much more resilient than they were prior to the 2008 crisis. ""The biggest risks are outside the largest banks,"" he said, and yet all banks are ""getting painted with the same brush."" Bank stocks, he said, ""have gotten Powelled,"" referring to the Fed chair. ""Going from zero to 5% interest rates in a period that is faster than any time in four decades, you are going to have casualties."" Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chair Martin Gruenberg highlighted the new interest rate risks facing the industry during a speech on March 6, noting that unrealized losses on available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities totaled $620 billion at the end of 2022 across all U.S. banks. ""The current interest rate environment has had dramatic effects on the profitability and risk profile of banks’ funding and investment strategies,"" he said. ""First, as a result of the higher interest rates, longer term maturity assets acquired by banks when interest rates were lower are now worth less than their face values. The result is that most banks have some amount of unrealized losses on securities."" These unrealized losses, he added, ""weaken a bank’s future ability to meet unexpected liquidity needs."" The good news, according to Gruenberg, is that ""banks are generally in a strong financial condition, and have not been forced to realize losses by selling depreciated securities.""

2023-03-09,BTC-USD,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-today-live-updates-march-9-2023-135006552.html,"Stocks got crushed on Thursday as worries rippled through the banking sector and investors remained on edge ahead of a crucial February jobs report slated for Friday morning. At the closing bell, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down 1.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was off by 1.6%, or 542 points, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down by 2%. Through Thursday's close the market was on pace for its worst week of the year, Bloomberg data showed. The selling on Thursday accelerated throughout the trading session as a collapse in shares of SVB Financial (SIVB) pressured bank stocks and raised concerns over previously unforeseen knock-on effects from the Federal Reserve's rate hiking campaign on the financial system. On Wednesday, SVB announced a $2.25 billion capital raise and the sale of nearly all of its securities portfolio for a loss of $1.8 billion. The company's Silicon Valley Bank subsidiary is the bank for many startups and other players in the venture world. In a letter to investors on Wednesday, the company said: ""We are taking these actions because we expect continued higher interest rates, pressured public and private markets, and elevated cash burn levels from our clients as they invest in their businesses."" The Information reported Thursday afternoon Greg Becker, CEO of Silicon Valley Bank, said on a call with investors, ""I would ask everyone to stay calm and to support us just like we supported you during the challenging times."" Becker also reportedly told investors the bank has ""ample liquidity,"" but said that ""if everyone is telling each other SVB is in trouble, that would be a challenge."" SVB shares fell 60% on Thursday. This decline also weighed on regional banks, with the SPDR Regional Banking ETF (KRE) falling 8% while the SPDR Financial Sector ETF (XLF) fell some 4%. Among major U.S. money-center banks, shares of JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), and Wells Fargo (WFC) were all down more than 5% on Thursday. First Republic Bank (FRC), which maintains a large high net-worth clients business, saw shares fall 16% during Thursday's trading session. As Bloomberg's Jonathan Ferro tweeted, Thursday seems to have marked the moment in the rate-hiking cycle that higher rates are good for banks until they are no longer good. Earlier Thursday, labor market data had been the main catalyst for the market as investors await a crucial jobs report set for release Friday morning. The weekly report on initial filings for unemployment insurance Thursday morning showed 211,000 claims were filed last week, an increase of 21,000 from the prior weak and what economists at Oxford Economics called the ""first hint of weakness"" in this data. ""The jump in jobless claims to 211k last week from 190k is the first sign of weakness in the claims data this year but is still well short of the 300k+ level that would be consistent with a recession,"" Michael Pearce, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients. ""As the Fed presses ahead with more rate hikes, we expect layoffs to eventually rise significantly."" The initial pop from stocks following this data came after two days of testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made clear interest rates are likely to go higher than expected amid strong labor market and inflation data. Stocks finished Wednesday's trading session mixed after a sell-off Tuesday that was triggered by comments from Powell suggesting the Fed will need to raise rates higher than previously forecasted amid stubborn inflation. ""I was surprised by Powell's willingness to accelerate the policy tightening pace, but I am not surprised by the admission that terminal rates will need to rise further,"" said Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro. ""At present, the futures market is priced for a [50 basis point] move in March. There is no point cracking open a door if you don’t intend to walk through."" Data from the CME Group shows markets placing an 80% on the Fed raising rates by 0.50% later this month. Elsewhere in markets, WTI crude oil fell about 1.5% to trade near $75.50 a barrel, a retreat from the $80 a barrel oil was trading near earlier this week. Investors were also keeping a close eye on the Treasury market with the 10-year yield firmer by about 5 basis points, trading at 3.92% after a move higher in yields earlier this week led to a deepening inversion of the yield curve. In single-stock news, shares of Silvergate (SI) were in focus on Thursday after the bank said late Wednesday it would liquidate and wind down its operations after suffering heavy losses amid huge deposit outflows from its digital asset client base. Shares of Silvergate, which have lost more than 95% over the last year, fell 41% on Thursday. Other stocks on the move on Thursday included MongoDB (MDB), which fell 8.3% following a disappointing quarterly report. On the flip side, shares of Asana (ASAN) gained 19% Thursday after a surprisingly strong quarter.

2023-03-09,BTC-USD,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/banks-tumble-svb-ignites-broader-173433069.html,"By Sinéad Carew (Reuters) - The S&P 500 bank index tumbled nearly 6% on Thursday in its biggest one-day drop in over two years as investors fled the industry following SVB Financial Group's share sale announcement and crypto bank Silvergate's decision to wind down operations. Shares of SVB, whose operating segments include Silicon Valley Bank, slumped over 50% in their deepest one-day drop on record after the company announced a $1.75 billion share sale late on Wednesday. SVB is battling cash burn due to declining deposits from startups struggling with a venture capital funding drought. San Francisco headquartered First Republic slumped 15% after hitting its lowest level since October 2020. The SPDR S&P regional banking ETF dropped more than 7% to its lowest level since January 2021. Major U.S. banks were also hit, with JPMorgan and Bank of America both down more than 5%. First Republic and SVB were the S&P 500's deepest percentage decliners in Thursday's trading session, while JPMorgan's loss weighed more than any other stock on the S&P 500's 1.1% decline at mid-day. ""The Silicon Valley raise got everybody nervous about people's capital levels and what deposits are doing. A lot of institutional investors don't feel great about owning certain banks right now,"" said R.J. Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. ""It just gets people freaked out because Silicon Valley, historically has been a very strong, well-run bank. If they're having issues right now, people are wondering what about other banks that are lesser quality and that don't have the reputation that Silicon Valley Bank has."" Investors were also grappling with the decline of cryptocurrency-focused lender Silvergate Capital, which dropped 22% after saying late on Thursday it planned to wind down operations and voluntarily liquidate after it was hit with losses following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. Shares in Silvergate peer Signature bank fell 9.4%.

2023-03-09,BTC-USD,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/mortgage-rates-increase-again-flirt-with-7-170227323.html,"Mortgage rates surged higher this week, closing in on 7%, further cementing affordability concerns in the housing market. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage increased to 6.73% from 6.65% the week prior, according to Freddie Mac. Rates have climbed nearly three-quarters of a point since the beginning of February. The jump in rates continued to fuel the standoff between price-struck homebuyers and hesitant sellers, as elevated home prices weigh on already weak demand ahead of the spring season. Add to that the expectation that rates could soon crest 7% if inflation remains a top concern. “It's not just higher mortgage rates, but really the combination of higher mortgage rates and still higher home prices in most markets that are creating hurdles for buyers,” Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale, told Yahoo Finance. “Even though a greater share of home sellers in today's market have adjusted their price lower, both listing and sale prices have continued to climb on a year-over-year basis.” While the volume of applications to purchase a home increased by 7% for the week ending March 3, overall purchase activity was 42% lower than a year ago, the Mortgage Bankers Association latest survey found. “Even with this jump in activity, both purchase and refinance applications remain well below year-ago levels when rates were much lower,” MBA President and CEO Bob Broeksmit told Yahoo Finance. “The recent increase in mortgage rates, right at the start of the busy spring buying season, could cause prospective buyers to delay decisions until rates moderate.” Buyers still in the market also have to contend with higher list prices from sellers. The national median listing price increased to $415,000 in February, Realtor.com data showed, up from $406,000 the previous month and up 7.8% year over year. That reverses several months of softening listing prices after peaking in June at $449,000, and could suggest that sellers are getting stubborn in offering incentives. Without wiggle room on prices, buyers are seeing their purchasing power evaporate amid rising interest rates. For instance, the monthly mortgage payment for a median-priced home is 49% higher than a year ago at last week’s rate of 6.65%, according to Realtor.com. Buyers are likely to face further affordability challenges entering the spring, Hale noted, because too-low inventory will continue to buoy home prices. “One big reason that home prices continue to climb is that even though we have more homes for sale today, the market is still not back to what was common before the pandemic in most places,” Hale said. “And fewer homes for sale mean there's still some pressure on prices even though buyers are more selective amid higher costs.” As homebuyer demand remains weak, home sellers are feeling more pessimistic and are much less active than last year. There were 15.9% fewer homes listed for sale in February compared with last year, data from Realtor.com showed. Meanwhile, there’s some evidence that sellers are a bit less generous with buyer incentives. For instance, 57% of builders used incentives to close sales in February, the National Association of Home Builders said, down from 62% in December and 59% in November. A growing share of sellers are also pulling back on price reductions, more so than what is typical during this time of the year. According to Realtor.com, 13% of home sellers issued a price cut in February, up from 5.4% a year ago. Still, in January at least 15.3% of sellers lowered their prices to make a sale. Mortgage rates have been marching higher since February after government data revealed the inflation remains a threat. This week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell made it clear to Congress that he isn’t ready to soften his aggressive fight on inflation, indicating that further rate hikes would likely be necessary as we enter the spring. That could likely keep mortgage rates higher. Though “forecasting is far more art than science,” Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com, anticipates that mortgage rates are likely to climb higher before they retreat later this year. “At present, and while there is a chance that rates could retreat to recent bottom levels or perhaps a little below at some point, much depends on what happens with prices, with the Fed, and ultimately whether or not the economy gets to a tipping point and starts to head into recession,” Gumbinger recently told Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-09,BTC-USD,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/9-ways-biden-is-set-to-raise-some-taxes-in-2024-budget-proposal-145357176.html,"President Biden is set to lay out vast and expensive ambitions in his 2024 budget Thursday from shoring up Medicare and boosting domestic spending to reducing the deficit by nearly $3 trillion over the coming decade. To pay for it all, he plans to propose a slate of tax increases, according to multiple peeks at the budget administration officials gave in recent days. There are new taxes on the business world focused on raising the rate on corporate income and on stock buybacks. He will also propose new taxes on wealthy Americans — from changes to how investment income is taxed to a revival of his ""billionaire minimum tax"" on wealth. “I want to make it clear I’m going to raise some taxes,” President Biden said during a recent stop in Virginia, offering one of his many previews of what's to come. Of course, presidential budget proposals are largely symbolic documents that are more about staking out a position rather than being enacted. But they serve as an important marker of Biden’s priorities for the year ahead. “What the president has really here to use is the bully pulpit, meaning once he puts his budget forward, is he going to continue to push some of those ideas?” asked Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget President Maya MacGuineas in a Yahoo Finance Live interview on Wednesday. “If he's serious about it, he'll push it.” Here are some of the new taxes set to be unveiled on Thursday In his budget, President Biden is set to renew his long-standing calls for more taxes on Corporate America. Included in a New York Times preview of the budget document are Biden’s desire to raise the corporate income tax rate to 28% from its current level of 21%. The president is also set to renew his call to quadruple the recently enacted excise tax on stock buybacks, a change he first offered earlier this year during his State of the Union address. On Jan. 1, a new 1% tax on share repurchases went into effect, but has done little to damp business enthusiasm for the practice. The provision is currently set to bring in about $74 billion over the coming decade, and Biden is proposing to increase the rate to 4%. And according to a document reviewed by Reuters, the budget will also propose scrapping tax breaks that oil and gas companies receive. That could likely open up another front in the back and forth between the White House and oil companies over record profits they've enjoyed since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The new proposals come after last year’s Inflation Reduction Act imposed multiple new taxes on businesses, including the 1% stock buyback excise tax and a new corporate book minimum tax. Going after more taxes so shortly after last year's victory likely will inflame critics. Erica York, a senior economist at the Tax Foundation, argued in an interview Wednesday with Yahoo Finance that Biden’s policies were already “heading in the wrong direction and the president's budget is going to double down on that.” “I would say wait and see how it plays out before you double down or quadruple down on it,” she added. Biden is also set to propose new taxes on Americans making over $400,000 a year. The president rolled out his most controversial proposal during this year’s State of the Union with a potential new tax that would target wealth, not just income. “We have to reward work, not just wealth,” President Biden said in his speech. “No billionaire should be paying a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter.” According to a preview offered to Bloomberg, the president will lay out new details on that, including a call for a 25% minimum tax on households worth more than $100 million as well as an increase in the capital gains rate for wealthy Americans. Other tax ideas that were present in previous budgets are set to be revived for 2024, including ending the so-called carried-interest loophole and eliminating some tax breaks around real-estate profits. All told, the various increases would fund nearly $3 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade and also fund other Biden priorities. The deficit reduction will come in a budget that “achieves this while lowering costs for families, investing in America, and protecting programs Americans have paid into because it proposes tax reforms to ensure the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share, while cutting wasteful spending on special interests — interests like Big Oil and Big Pharma,” Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Wednesday. Finally, the White House previewed new taxes to shore up the Medicare program earlier this week. Biden will propose increases on payroll taxes on Americans making over $400,000 per year; closing loopholes that shields some “pass-through” income from Medicare taxes; and allowing Medicare to negotiate on a wider array of prescription drugs. Those provisions, which Biden reviewed in a New York Times op-ed on Tuesday, would extend the program through 2050. Critics have noted that many of these proposals would be untested ways to fund the health care program for retirees. York also noted that some of the rule changes around the net investment income tax would help Medicare's finances by diverting some money from the government’s general fund. “Of course that looks like you're strengthening Medicare, but you're creating a hole in the budget elsewhere,” she said, noting the plan also increases the net investment income tax from 3.8% to 5% and would therefore also bring in more money overall. Republicans have been promising for weeks that Biden’s proposals won’t see the light of day. This is hardly new — there's an old saying in Washington about budgets that “the president proposes and Congress disposes” — but it will nevertheless increase pressure on House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) to offer his own proposal in the coming months. MacGuineas, who previewed the dueling proposals, noted that the White House budget will likely focus on tax increases and the GOP plan will revolve around spending cuts. “Neither of them is realistic, and, frankly, neither of them is the right policy,” she said. “We need compromises on both.” Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. Fed chair Jay Powell just poured cold water on the ""no landing"" crowd hoping to avert a U.S. recession and rally stocks to fresh record highs this year. After two days of grilling before Congress, investors have been reminded (again) that the Fed chief still sees inflation as a persistent, pernicious threat. Stocks and bonds took notice Wednesday, as both sold off amid surging short-term rates — leaving the major indices underwater for the week as of the close. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes,"" said Powell before the Senate. And with two weeks to go until the next Fed meeting, markets are now expecting exactly that. Bonds and derivatives are pricing in a more hawkish outcome — expecting the Fed to lift its benchmark rate 50 basis points instead of 25 basis points. Since Monday's settlement, the U.S. 2-year Treasury-Note yield has surged 18 basis points to 5.06% — the highest level since 2007. It also deepened its inversion over the 10-year yield, with the spread reaching negative 108 basis points (or -1.08 percentage points) — the highest since the early 1980s when Paul Volcker was the Fed chair fighting a similar battle over price inflation. Under normal conditions, interest rates of longer-term loans or bonds (the cost of money) are expected to be more expensive than their shorter-term counterparts, as risk is higher on the long end. But this changes when the Fed starts stamping out animal spirits, lifting short-term rates to restrict the creation of credit and eventually choke off growth. While the magnitude, or depth, of a yield curve inversion isn't necessarily predictive of a deeper, or longer recession, there are a host of other indicators in the bond market that are sounding alarm bells. Former bond trader and CEO of TheMacroCompass.com Alfonso Peccatiello recently joined Yahoo Finance Live to offer his insights. Peccatiello notes that the bond market expects the Fed to fight inflation and remain tight, with interest rates well over 5% a year from now. ""That cannot happen if a recession is unfolding. The Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates,"" he said. Essentially, the inflation-fighting credibility that Powell has earned in the markets comes with a cost — pushing expectations of Fed capitulation far beyond what occurs historically. ""The issue is — the tighter you keep borrowing conditions for the private sector, the higher you keep mortgage rates, the higher you keep corporate borrowing rates — the higher the chances you're going to freeze these credit markets and basically sleepwalk into an accident or, in general, accelerate a recession later on,"" said Peccatiello. But long before the Fed delivers relief in the form of cuts, Peccatiello expects stocks to suffer from an earnings recession, which, he says, ""isn't fully priced in."" (An earnings recession — marked by two consecutive quarterly declines in S&P 500 earnings — often, but not always precedes an economic recession.) Peccatiello believes the U.S. is already in an earnings recession, with stocks reflecting complacency. Nevertheless, he doesn't expect a disaster. He sees about 10% maximum downside risk in the S&P 500 down to the 3600 level, which is right around last year's lows. ""I don't think it's going to be much lower than that,"" he says, adding, ""[T]he stock market generally bottoms before earnings bottom."" The reason gets back to the Fed, which historically capitulates and slashes rates as earnings drop. The Fed rate cuts then get incorporated into better stock valuations, which eventually halt the decline in stock prices, Peccatiello added. ""[This] means the stock market can stop its decline and start slowly but surely moving into a new bull market.""

""We have not made any decision,"" he told the House Financial Services Committee, saying key reports on employment and inflation would govern any moves. The remarks came a day after he told the Senate Banking Committee that, ""we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes"" if the data supported it. That spurred traders to price in a higher chance of a 0.50% hike than a 0.25% increase later this month. “We're going to be looking at the totality of data,"" Powell said Wednesday during questioning from House members. ""We are not on a preset path,"" he added. Powell said the Fed wants to see the upcoming employment report Friday, along with key inflation reports on the consumer and producer price indexes, before making a judgment. On Wednesday, the Dow dropped 0.18%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.14%, and the Nasdaq rose 0.40%. When asked by Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D, Mass.) whether the Fed would pause interest rates to avoid a recession, the chairman called it a serious question and noted that he wouldn’t say yes or no. The Fed, he said, is not ""seeking a recession."" Powell also said the era of low interest rates is likely over. ""Now, we have the 10-year [Treasury yield] back close to 4%,"" said Powell. ""And I think, we need to be careful not to assume that these secular low, longer term rates, will continue indefinitely because it doesn't look likely now."" Democrats, including Democratic Ranking Member Maxine Waters (D, CA) asked him to comment on the prospect of a U.S. default if Congress is not able to raise the debt ceiling. Powell warned that the Fed can’t protect the economy from brinksmanship or a default. ""No one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the non-payment of the government's bills, let alone a debt default, which I don't think will happen, but no one should think we have the tools to protect against the effects of that,"" said Powell. When asked whether the Fed would accept a trillion-dollar coin to avoid a debt default, Powell said there are no rabbits to be pulled out of hats and that would be a ""rabbit coming out of a hat."" House Republicans expressed concerns about reviewing and potentially increasing capital requirements for banks. Patrick McHenry, the chairman of the House committee, questioned the motivation of a ""holistic review"" of these requirements from the Fed’s Vice Chair of Supervision Michael Barr, saying the Fed shouldn’t operate in the shadows when the regulation in question can have broad and significant economic effects. McHenry also accused the Fed of laying the groundwork for a new climate policy. ""The Fed needs to stick to its knitting,"" said McHenry. ""I agree there is concern for many that the Fed is picking up new needles and knitting partisan sweaters at such a precarious time for our economy here at home in the global economy. That would be a mistake."" Powell’s comments Wednesday were his last before the Fed’s policy meeting in two weeks.

2023-03-08,BTC-USD,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-march-8-2023-124051164.html,"U.S. stocks finished mixed on Wednesday, following two job prints that showed the labor market remains tight amid sticky inflation. Wall Street also heard from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday morning. Powell continued to stress that ""no decision"" has been made on the size of the Fed's upcoming interest-rate increase at its March policy meeting. ""When say we will look at the totality of data, that will include these next reports. We will carefully analyze. Haven't made a decision on the March meeting. Larger point is that we are not on a preset path,"" said Powell during his second day of testimony before Congress. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended the day up 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined by 0.2%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added 0.4%. Bond yields inched higher alongside a stronger dollar. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked up to 3.98% Wednesday. U.S. stocks plummeted Tuesday after Powell said during his Senate Banking Committee testimony that interest rates may rise “higher” than previously expected as the Fed continues a persistent fight against inflation. Powell’s comments on Capitol Hill triggered a 1.5% selloff in equities, according to JP Morgan’s trading desk. Tuesday’s losses saw every sector lower, with financials and real estate logging the biggest declines for the day. Treasury yields were higher, with the 2-year yield tipping above 5%, while the spread between the 10-year and 2-year US Treasury yields inverted for the first time since September 1981. According to strategists at Deutsche Bank, reaching this level signals a recession could be underway or has occurred within a maximum of eight months. “Powell’s speech indicates that the Fed will heavily depend on near-term data for upcoming rates decisions,” Michael Feroli, Chief U.S. Economist at JP Morgan, wrote in a note Wednesday morning. ""With January’s macro data mostly printing on the hawkish side, NFP Friday and CPI next Tuesday are the most critical catalysts for Fed’s decision between 25bp and 50bp,” Feroli added. Still, on the economic data side, ADP’s monthly read on private payroll growth rose by 242,000 in February, above consensus expectations for 200,000. ADP also tracked pay growth for those workers who stayed in their position, which decelerated to 7.2% last month, the slowest pace of gains within in the last year. “There is a tradeoff in the labor market right now,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist, ADP, wrote in the press release. ""We're seeing robust hiring, which is good for the economy and workers, but pay growth is still quite elevated. The modest slowdown in pay increases, on its own, is unlikely to drive down inflation rapidly in the near term.” Meanwhile, the U.S. monthly international trade deficit increased to $68.3 billion in January, below the consensus deficit of $68.7 billion as imports increased more than exports, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the U.S. Census Bureau. Another highlight Wednesday morning was January’s report on the number of job openings, which fell to 10.82 million, down from the upwardly revised 11.2 million openings in the prior month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. The construction, leisure, hospitality, and finance industries showed significant pullbacks in job openings. ""While the January JOLTS report shows job openings are heading in the right direction for the Fed, the decline is far too modest to convince that labor market conditions are cooling enough to bring down inflation,"" Matthew Martin, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a statement following the release. February’s jobs report out on Friday will hold more clues about the strength of the economy. Economists expect 215,000 new jobs will be added to the economy, a slower pace than January’s blowout number of 517,000 job additions. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.4%. Another key point from the reading will be wage growth, with a 0.3% month-to-month bump in average hourly earnings anticipated and 4.7% over the last year. In single-stock moves, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) gained over 2% Wednesday after a regulatory filing revealed that Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway bought nearly 6 million shares of the oil company in recent days, raising its stake in the company to 200.2 million shares worth $12.2 billion. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD) shares rose 3% Wednesday after the security software provider reported fourth-quarter earnings that topped analysts' expectations and issued stronger guidance for the fiscal first quarter. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) dipped 3% as Berenberg analyst Adrian Yanoshik slashed his rating on the stock from buy to hold, citing ""based on misplaced fears of a price war – appears to have been accepted by the market,"" Yanoshik noted. Separately, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened an investigation into the Model Y SUV over a concern with its steering wheels. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-08,BTC-USD,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/key-recession-indicator-yield-inversion-treasury-160255114.html,"The Treasury market is sending its sharpest warning about recession risks since 1981. On Tuesday, the difference in the yield on 2-year and 10-year Treasury notes further inverted, with the yield on the 10-year falling 103 basis points, or 1.03 percentage points, below the yield on the 2-year yield. This dynamic has preceded each of the last eight U.S. recessions. By this measure, the yield curve has been inverted since July of last year as investors bet aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve to combat inflation would tip the economy into recession. In an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled the central bank will likely be more aggressive than it previously forecast in raising interest rates this year as inflation proves stubborn and the labor market remains strong. ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,"" Powell told the Senate Banking Committee in prepared remarks. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes."" ""Although inflation has been moderating in recent months, the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy,"" Powell added. The Fed will announce its next policy decision on March 22, a statement that will also be accompanied by new projections on where Fed officials see interest rates headed over the rest of this year and the next two. Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients Tuesday that Powell ""opened the door for the central bank to accelerate the pace of rate hikes and raise the target range of the fed funds rate more than anticipated because of the recent hot data on job growth and inflation."" Sweet noted investors are now pricing in 100 basis points of additional rate hikes from the Fed this year, up from the 75 basis points previously expected by most economists. Data from the CME Group showed Wednesday morning markets are now pricing in a nearly 80% chance the Fed raises rates by 50 basis points, or 0.50%, at its meeting later this month. As Yahoo Finance's Brian Cheung noted last year, there is nothing about Treasury yields themselves, or the relationship between the yield at any two points along the curve, that signals recession. Rather, it is what yields imply about future interest rates — and in turn future economic growth — that offers worrying signs for investors. While it is hotly debated what, exactly, ""goes into"" the yield for any Treasury security, a simple axiom used by many investors says Treasury yields indicate what the expected average of the fed funds rate, or the Fed's benchmark interest rate, will be over a given time period. With the 2-year yield standing at around 5% as of Wednesday morning, this implies investors think the fed funds rate will be, on average, 5% over the next two years. Today, the fed funds rate stands at roughly 4.6%, as the Fed's target interest rate range is 4.5%-4.75% following its decision last month to raise rates an additional 25 basis points. Therefore, we can say investors are anticipating the Fed will raise rates to at least 5% and keep them there for two years, or raise rates above 5% for some period of time before cutting them such that the average Fed funds rate is 5%. Duke professor Campbell Harvey, who uncovered this ""recession indicator"" in the 1980s, told Bloomberg in an interview earlier this year he thinks the economy can avoid recession despite warnings coming from his work. In part, in Harvey's view, this is because market awareness of this indicator has lessened its potency as a predictive measure. Notably, Harvey's worked actually focused on the spread between the 3-month Treasury bill and the 10-year Treasury note as the most potent recession indicator, not the now-popular 2-year/10-year spread. The spread between these two tenors along the curve currently stands at minus 107 basis points, still a clear recession signal by Harvey's work.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. The retail business is simple — buy from wholesalers, sell to consumers, pocket the difference. In exchange for capturing this difference between the wholesale and retail cost of goods, retailers take on the financial risk of fronting money to one party while working to make it back and then some from another. At the scale of the U.S. consumer economy, the differences between an additional week in a quarter, an additional weekend in a month, or even an additional day in a year can be millions of dollars or more. And if the timing of a day or two can disrupt the financial fortunes of a business — meaning there can be just hours between profits and losses — then one can imagine the challenges faced by retailers during the supply chain disruptions that results from the pandemic. In 2021, the story was that retailers were unable to match consumer demand as the economy re-opened. In 2022, supply chains that got unstuck eventually left retailers with more stock than they needed. As 2023 gets underway, retailers are suggesting the balance may finally be just right. Sporting goods retailer Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) reported fourth quarter results Tuesday morning that impressed investors, with shares rising 11% after the company offered a full-year earnings forecast well above expectations. And driving this profit forecast were inventories that are in ""great shape"" ahead of the company's busy spring season. ""As planned, we continued to address targeted inventory overages, and as a result our inventory is in great shape as we start 2023. We couldn't be more excited about our spring assortment,"" said Lauren Hobart, president and CEO. Dick's CFO Navdeep Gupta added on a call with analysts Tuesday morning, ""We were chasing inventory last year amidst industry-wide supply chain disruptions. ...Compared to Q4 of 2019, a 38% increase in sales was well ahead of our 29% increase in inventory. Our inventory is healthy and well positioned."" Looking at economy-wide data, we can see inventory-to-sales levels are still depressed relative to pre-pandemic levels. Though this measure is in part driven by strong sales, which keeps the ratio of inventories to sales low. Still, comments from Dick's were the latest echo of a refrain heard often from the industry as retail results have poured in over the last few weeks. And that refrain says the industry is finally finding something like a ""normal"" setting after three pandemic-altered years. Back in late February, Walmart (WMT) CEO Doug McMillon said his team, ""acted quickly and aggressively to address the inventory and cost challenges we faced last year."" ""We ended the quarter with inventory about flat to last year which is better than we anticipated and even better when you consider how inflation lifts that number,"" McMillon added on a call with analysts. ""And [we] did it while improving in-stock levels."" McMillon added: ""And so as we look at where we are today with much better position around inventory...I feel like this year will be more of a normal environment for markdowns or certainly more normal than what it was last year."" The company did, however, say there was ""work to be done"" on its apparel inventory levels. But clothing retailers Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN) both indicated in their latest reports inventory levels continue to improve. ""Despite an increasingly volatile macroeconomic climate, through the ongoing execution of our Polaris strategy, we remained agile, pivoted to meet customer demand and elevated our approach to inventory management,” said Jeff Gennette, Macy's chairman and CEO. ""In the fourth quarter, we benefited from our disciplined inventory approach."" The company reported inventory levels that were down 3% from last year and said, ""Inventory productivity continues to be a focus for the company in 2023 and beyond."" Nordstrom, for its part, said inventory levels were down 15% from last year and at levels similar to those that prevailed in 2019, the last year before the pandemic. ""We took decisive actions to right-size our inventory as we entered the new year, positioning us for greater agility amidst continuing macroeconomic uncertainty,"" said CEO Erik Nordstrom.

At the closing bell on Tuesday, the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 1.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) sunk 1.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) plummeted 1.2%. Tuesday's losses saw the S&P 500 fall by the most in two weeks and trade back below the key 4,000 level. The index also broke its 50-day moving average, an indicator traders closely watch for signs stocks are breaking from recent trends. ""Fed Chair Jerome Powell confirmed today that interest rates are set to rise higher than we previously anticipated,"" wrote Andrew Hunter, deputy chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. ""But with most evidence still pointing to economic weakness and markedly lower inflation this year, we still believe the Fed will begin cutting rates again sooner than markets are expecting."" Powell delivered the first of his two days of semi-annual testimony to Congress on Tuesday, speaking before the Senate Banking Committee ahead of Wednesday's appearance before the House Financial Services Committee. In his prepared testimony released Tuesday, Powell spoke of a sustained central bank campaign to rein in inflation. ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,"" Powell said. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes."" Answering questions from lawmakers, Powell said the full impacts of the Fed's interest rate increases haven't yet been felt in the economy. Markets have begun to price in at least two additional 0.25% rate hikes from the central bank over its next two meetings; investors began the year with optimism the Fed would stop its rate-hiking campaign as soon as February. Powell's comments Tuesday opened the door to the possibility of both a higher terminal federal funds rate, as well as a higher pace of increases. According to data from CME Group, Powell's comments spurred traders to price in a higher chance of a 0.50% hike than a 0.25% increase later this month. The Fed will kick off its next two-day policy meeting in two weeks, with a policy announcement set for the afternoon of March 22. Elsewhere in markets, WTI crude oil was under pressure, falling more than 3.7% to around $77.40 per barrel. The 10-year Treasury yield, which has been a focal point of market action over the last few weeks, was little-changed, settling near 3.98%. On the earnings side, results from Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) early this morning sent shares of the sporting goods retailer higher by 11%. The company offered full-year earnings per share guidance that came in more than $1 per share above expectations, according to Bloomberg data. Dick's expects to earn $12.90-$13.80 per share in its fiscal 2023, up from the $12.04 the company earned last year. Same-store sales in the company's fourth quarter rose 5.3% with CEO Ed Stack telling investors the company's inventory levels are in ""great shape"" to start 2023. Elsewhere in single-stock moves, shares of Snap (SNAP) gained more than 9% on Monday — and had been up as much as 4% on Tuesday before paring gains to close up just 0.5% — with Bloomberg attributing the rally to optimism over a TikTok ban in the U.S. Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"
2023-03-07,BTC-USD,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/powell-tells-congress-rates-will-likely-be-higher-than-previously-anticipated-150011657.html,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Tuesday interest rates are likely to rise more than previously expected as the central bank works to bring down inflation, which remains stubbornly above the central bank's 2% target. U.S. stocks were trading lower Tuesday as some analysts said the comments were more hawkish than expected. Near 2:20 p.m. ET, the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) was near session lows, falling 1.5%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) off 1.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) falling 1.2%. ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,"" Powell told the Senate Banking Committee in prepared remarks. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes."" ""Although inflation has been moderating in recent months, the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy,"" Powell added. The latest Consumer Price Index report released last month showed prices rose 6.4% over the prior year in January, a slowdown from last summer's peak inflation rate of 9.1% but still well above the Fed's 2% target. Powell's comments spurred traders to price in a higher chance of a 0.50% hike than a 0.25% increase later this month, according to data from CME Group. In a note, Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner said Powell’s remarks ""opened the door"" to a return of 0.50% hikes, ""If the incoming data flow warrants it."" If there are ""upside surprises"" in a jobs report this Friday from the Labor Department, that could ""drive a faster and longer tightening cycle,"" according to Zentner's note. The Fed projected at its December policy meeting interest rates would need to rise to a range of 5%-5.25% this year, though Powell's comments now suggest rates will need to eventually rise above this level. Following the Fed's February policy decision, the central bank's benchmark interest rate stands in a range of 4.5%-4.75%. Some Senate Democrats challenged Powell during Tuesday’s hearing, cautioning that his rate hikes could lead to job losses. Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown (D-OH) said there are other ways to bring down prices, citing the strengthening of supply chains, boosting of U.S. manufacturing and the rebuilding of infrastructure. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said if the central bank raises rates as much as planned, to 5%-5.25% excluding any further rate hikes Powell has now suggested above that level, unemployment would rise to 4.6%. That, she said, would cost two million people jobs. ""Chair Powell, if you could speak directly to the two million hardworking people who have decent jobs today, who you're planning to get fired over the next year, what would you say to them?"" Warren asked. Powell, in response, said: ""I would explain to people more broadly that inflation is extremely high and it's hurting the working people of this country badly. All of them, not just two million of them, but all of them are suffering under high inflation, and we are taking the only measures we have to bring inflation down."" In a hat tip to these concerns, Powell said in his prepared remarks that the Fed is ""acutely aware"" high inflation is causing ""significant hardship"" for Americans while also pledging to “stay the course until the job is done."" The Fed chair said Tuesday policymakers will continue to make decisions on a meeting by meeting basis. Powell noted that economic data from January on inflation, job growth, consumer spending, and manufacturing production have partly reversed course from the slowdown seen back in December. Powell attributed some of the softening to unseasonably warm weather in January, but cautioned that the ""breadth of the reversal"" suggests inflation is running higher than expected. He reiterated the Fed still needs to see a drop in services inflation excluding housing to bring inflation down, which is likely to require a weaker job market.

2023-03-07,BTC-USD,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/heres-what-biden-wants-to-do-to-shore-up-medicare-135302609.html,"President Biden is set to formally release his 2024 budget proposal later this week and is already offering previews on what he plans to do with Medicare. In new details released Tuesday to keep the program afloat into the 2050s, Biden says he can extend the solvency of the program without any benefit cuts via three moves: an increase on the tax rate on both earned and unearned income above $400,000; the closing of loopholes that shields some “pass-through” income from Medicare taxes; and allowing Medicare to negotiate on a wider array of prescription drugs. And overall, the president is looking at least five different tax changes for wealthy Americans and corporations to pay for his myriad ideas — both for Medicare and his larger push to “invest in America” and pay down the deficit. And while the proposal isn’t likely to get a vote on Capitol Hill, it will serve as an important marker of Biden’s priorities. The early focus on Medicare — as well as Social Security — underlines just how “deeply embedded” the twin programs have become in Biden’s political identity, Alex Lawson, the executive director of a group called Social Security Works, recently noted in an interview. The president talks nearly every week about the program and also released a New York Times op-ed on the topic Tuesday morning. Defending the programs now “seems to be one of the defining characteristics of Biden-world,” Lawson added. What the White House appears to be doing with this week’s choreographed multi-day rollout — culminating in a formal unveiling on Thursday in Philadelphia — is an attempt to shape the conversation as both the debt ceiling fight heats up this summer and a likely Biden 2024 re-election campaign kicks off. In the op-ed released Tuesday morning, President Biden wrote that “Medicare is more than a government program. It’s the rock-solid guarantee that Americans have counted on to be there for them when they retire."" The issue is top of mind with a key Medicare trust fund likely to run low on funds as early as 2028, according to a recent government trustees report. Meanwhile, Social Security likely has the funds to continue paying out current benefits for only a few years longer, through 2034. Biden’s proposal would increase the Medicare tax rate from 3.8% to 5% on all income above $400,000. It would also target what is known as net investment income - an additional fee on the returns for high-income earners as well as “pass through” business for Americans above $400,000 per year. The White House aims to change the rules and close loopholes around that income, which it notes can be shielded from the taxes that fund the Medicare program because it is classified currently as “neither earned income nor investment income.” The proposal would close loopholes in that area and also change the government's rules to allow that money to be sent to Medicare’s crucial Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, President of the American Action Forum, noted in a Yahoo Finance Live interview on Tuesday that the net investment tax piece is ""really using a tool that has never been used in Medicare before [and] it's not a particularly good piece of tax policy."" Holtz-Eakin, a Republican and former director of the Congressional Budget Office, added that the way to get these programs under control fiscally is to control growth, and ""you can't tax your way out of this."" The budget will also propose savings via new prescription drug reforms by giving Medicare the authority to negotiate prices for additional higher-cost drugs. The White House estimates these changes will save $200 billion over the coming decade. “There are ways in which the program can be operated more efficiently,” said Paul Van de Water, a Medicare specialist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who also listed other options for the years ahead like lowering payment rates to healthcare providers and limiting payments to Medicare Advantage. But even with all that, “it's still going to be essential we think to raise additional revenues,” he said. Van de Water also noted that Biden has previously proposed changes to the net investment income tax during a previous budget proposal. Thursday’s release will be Biden’s third since taking office. Tuesday’s unveiling is just the first step in what is much more detail to come about Biden's ideas and how he’ll pay for it all. In a recent online video, Biden’s budget director, Shalanda Young, outlined the overall priorities, including expanding the economy, lowering costs, protecting Social Security and Medicare as well as reducing the deficit by $2 trillion over the coming decade. So what other tax increases could be proposed? Administration officials say that both wealthy Americans and corporations will be the focus. In his State of the Union, Biden called to quadruple the excise tax on stock buybacks and to institute a new ""billionaire minimum tax"" on wealth. Both appear set for repeat appearances on Thursday. The president could also call to raise the top corporate tax rate, which would come in addition to a corporate minimum tax instituted last year as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. While House Republicans have pledged that all tax increases are off the table and won't be considered in the House. But the move will increase the pressure on Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) to release his own plan, something he has promised is coming soon. What Speaker McCarthy has discussed in the past is creating the “path” to balance the budget. House Republicans have already floated some small-scale proposals — targeting things like Medicaid and what they term as “woke waste.” What’s unclear — and Democrats and some budget experts charge is impossible — is how that plan takes a significant bite out of the deficit if Social Security, Medicare, and tax increases are all off the table. “We’re not going to sit here and be lectured by those folks about fiscal responsibility,” Biden said recently in a preview of the likely debate to come, adding of the GOP, it will “be interesting to see what they want to cut and what their numbers add up to.” This post has been updated.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. When Fed Chair Jay Powell settles in for his semi-annual testimony to the Senate Banking Committee today, investors will be looking for confirmation that the central bank is going to keep raising interest rates for the next several meetings to fight inflation. Besides the ongoing debate about whether the Fed’s actions are going to send the U.S. economy into recession and stocks into a tailspin, there’s been one other important side effect: the bond market is the hottest it’s been in years. That’s newly true not just for institutional investors, but for retail traders as well. That’s because online trading of Treasuries is accessible at a critical mass for the first time with rates at these levels. It's never been easier to buy, be it directly via the Treasury Department, from the discount brokerages, or through ETFs. The repricing of rate expectations this year has sent yields on many Treasury notes and bonds to their highest in 15 years, with the 2-year, 10-year (TNX), and 30-year all yielding around 4%. It’s been a huge shift for fixed income. Besides institutional investors salivating over government and corporate debt, retail traders are so keen they've repeatedly crashed the TreasuryDirect website, which provides a conduit to Treasuries and I bonds. (The latter is an inflation-protected instrument that has both a fixed rate and one that changes with inflation). “For pretty much the entire decade, leading up to this year, when people asked about retail and fixed income, I could just simply say, ‘no one really cares.’ The past year, that has significantly changed,” Shawn Cruz, Head Trading Strategist at TD Ameritrade, told Yahoo Finance. Sales of Treasury bills – those with maturities of one year or less – through TreasuryDirect were $12.0 billion in January, a record. Before last August, that number hadn’t cracked $5 billion. Net sales of I bonds were $4.2 billion in January, after spiking to $6.8 billion last October. Salim Ramji, Global Head of iShares and Index Investments at BlackRock, was enthusiastic about fixed income when he recently spoke to Yahoo Finance: “It’s a great time for investors to look for yield, but they don’t have to take the kind of risk that they might have two, three, four years ago, because you can get 4% yields in Treasuries. You can get 5% yields in investment grade, even at the front end.” BlackRock, as the largest provider of ETFs by assets, has benefited from the boom. Thus far in 2023, investors have poured $9.9 billion into U.S. iShares fixed income ETFs. And not all investors are going long; the firm’s most popular instrument in February in the category was the iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF (SHV). How long will the party last? Even if the Fed raises interest rates at its next three meetings, some strategists have called for a longer period of higher inflation and higher interest rates, an end to the so-called “Great Moderation.”  BlackRock predicts that fixed income ETF assets under management will reach $5 trillion by 2030. As Ramji said, “Having rates as low as they were for as long as they were was kind of the aberration. I think we’re resetting back now to a much more normal fixed income environment, and the great thing for investors, as a result, is they can use it to generate income, and so for retirees or people looking at their wealth portfolios, they’re able to generate good, long-term income from long-term investments like Treasuries or investment grade.” In other words, for a lot of retail investors right now, boring is beautiful. - Economy Wholesale Inventories, January Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before Senate Banking Committee Earnings Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS); Casey's General (CASY); CrowdStrike (CRWD); Manchester United (MANU); Sea Limited (SE); Stitch Fix (SFIX); Thor Industries (THO) Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended the session near the flatline, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) increased 0.1%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) edged down 0.1%, reversing its gains from earlier in the trading session. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note hovered near 4% Monday afternoon, before settling at 3.98%. Crude oil traded higher, with U.S. benchmark WTI up at $80.55 a barrel. The dollar index moved lower trading at $104.34. U.S. stocks gained on Friday to close out a volatile week, while bond yields pulled back from their recent highs. The three major indexes rose for the week, with the Dow Jones adding 1.7%, the S&P 500 closing 1.9% higher, and the Nasdaq gaining 2.6%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury settled back below the key 4% level, and the two-year yield fell to 4.86%. Economic data released on Friday showed the services sector grew in February. This week, Wall Street will be paying close attention to the monthly jobs report out Friday. The February jobs report is expected to show 215,000 new jobs have been added to the economy, according to economist estimates, a slower pace from January’s blowout number of 517,000 job additions. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.4%. Another key point from the report will be wage growth, with a 0.3% month-to-month bump in average hourly earnings anticipated and 4.7% over the last year. Economists at Bank of America, led by Michael Gapen, believe a deceleration from January will be tied largely to weather shifts and a general mean-reverting nature of payrolls. ""Typically, when payroll growth records a sizable increase or decrease, we see a reversal in the following month,"" the firm noted. Also, investors will be keeping an eye on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's two-day biannual monetary policy testimony on Capitol Hill, which begins Tuesday. Other highlights this week include ADP’s monthly read on private payroll growth, January’s report on job openings from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Fed’s Beige Book. In single stock moves, Apple (AAPL) shares gained nearly 2% on Monday as Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng initiated coverage of Apple with a buy rating and a price target of $199. Ng noted Apple's success in hardware design and brand loyalty has led to a growing installed base of users that provide visibility into revenue growth. And Apple's valuation is attractive relative to its historical multiple and to peers. Ciena (CIEN) shares jumped 4% Monday after the company posted better than expected results that topped analysts expectations amid strong demand in its networking platforms business. Shares of BridgeBio Pharma (BBIO) surged more than 50% after the company topped Wall Street's expectations in a study of children with achondroplasia, a genetic condition that slows bone growth. Snap (SNAP) shares climbed 9% amid growing chatter that the U.S. could restrict — or ban — use of the TikTok app. Spirit Airlines (SAVE) shares tanked nearly 9% following reports that JetBlue Airways (JBLU) is bracing for turbulence from the Justice Department as it tries to block the airline's planned takeover of Spirit Airlines in the coming days, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Investors cheered the company's quarter by sending shares up 13% on February 15, the stock's biggest one-day increase since Airbnb's December 2020 IPO. On February 16, the stock logged its highest close since May 2022. Even after giving back some post-earnings gains, Airbnb stock is up about 45% from a record low reached at the end of 2022. But the sentiment shift came as something of a surprise to hosts and managers using the home-booking platform who say they are finding it harder and harder to book guests. Ric Kenworthy, who manages 96 short-rental property listings through a company, Old Town Rental, in Arizona, was scrambling to fill unbooked units ahead of last month's Super Bowl in Glendale. ""We ended up at, let's just assume midday Saturday before the Super Bowl, close to 90% booked for all of our properties,"" Kenworthy told Yahoo Finance, later adding: ""Some key markets are experiencing quite a bit of saturation."" Kenworthy said he ended up cutting his listing prices by 50%: The going-rate for one of his rental properties went for $450-$600 a night that weekend after he'd been anticipating a rate closer to $1,000 a night given the demand generally created by an event like the Super Bowl. ""In 2022, we saw new heights in demand on the Airbnb platform and the result is continued growth in typical Host income, which was over $14,000 in the US,"" Sam Randall, a representative for Airbnb, told Yahoo Finance in a statement. ""We continue to invest in the success of our Host community and in the coming months will release new pricing tools to help them set competitive prices."" While some Airbnb hosts may not be feeling the full benefits, there is little doubt travel demand is back in full swing. Despite sticky inflation, consumers are booking trips: Data from a Bank of America Institute survey shows money spent on airline travel per household jumped 3.5% in January while international spending also increased compared to two years ago. ""I think the psychological impact of being locked down for some portion of the pandemic has only accelerated the trend that had already started,"" Marriott International (MAR) CEO Anthony Capuano told Yahoo Finance Live after the company's fourth-quarter earnings results showed the average room rates up 13% and revenue earned per average room jumping 29% year over year. Airbnb posted revenue of $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter, better than analyst expectations for revenues of $1.86 billion. The company's earnings per share also topped estimates, coming in at $0.48 cents against $0.08 forecasted. On the company's earnings call, CEO Brian Chesky told analysts Airbnb experienced ""tremendous growth"" in units listed online, ending 2022 with 6.6 million active listings. That was 16% higher compared to the previous year. Chesky attributed the increase in supply to two factors: demand and systematic improvements to their platform. As people flocked back to traveling, nights and experiences booked increased 20% in the fourth quarter, with active bookers in the fourth quarter reaching a record for the company. ""[Annual] revenue of $8.4 billion grew 40% year-over-year,"" Chesky said on the earnings call. ""And when you exclude foreign exchange, our revenue increased by 46% year-over-year."" The average daily rate for an Airbnb accommodation grew 36% compared to 2019 levels, according to CFO David Stephenson. He noted that it's generally ""more expensive"" to stay at an Airbnb than other accommodations and projected rates would come down ""modestly"" through the end of this year. ""We're not seeing any major shifts in overall kind of utilization rate that give us any concern,"" Stephenson said. ""We feel like we continue to keep, in aggregate, this nice balance of growing supply and growing demand, and we want to keep that relative balance."" Airbnb also stressed that the company is focused on three strategic priorities: raising awareness of hosting, upgrading core services, and scaling services beyond its core offerings. In late 2022, Airbnb added short-term sublet listings in an effort to grow its footprint among the multifamily market. The company asserted landlords and property managers using the sublet service could earn about 20% of the booking revenue. Airbnb also rolled out new categories, including one called ""OMG,"" which captures the most unique and exclusive accommodations. And after a Wall Street Journal report highlighted how some travelers were frustrated with host-mandated chore lists and the app's pricing format leading to sneaky costs, Airbnb launched a feature to show users price totals that include cleaning, service, and other fees. Looking ahead, some wonder about the sustainability of Airbnb's boom. “Can the top line demand persist? And then given their growth and supply, can the average rates [hold]?,” Nick Jones, research analyst at JMP Securities, told Yahoo Finance. ""If the demand wanes, that's going to increase available supply at any given day, which then... should result in lower prices, which then would impact their profitability."" Even if demand plateaus, the situation could change: January data from AirDNA suggested that rapid listing growth ""outpaced rising demand"" in 2022. ""U.S. short-term rentals earned over $62 billion ($141 billion globally) throughout the year (up 25.1% YoY), with almost 200 million nights stayed and over two million listings receiving at least one booking,"" AirDNA stated. ""Overall occupancy ended the year at 58.7%, a significant drop from the 61.3% in 2021."" In any case, as travel evolves after the pandemic bust and boom, some Airbnb hosts see a shift in consumer behavior. Michelle Burson, owner of a 4,000 square-foot Airbnb in Brookings, Oregon, is experiencing less foot traffic for her rental unit. ""Our bookings [have] declined last year compared to the previous year,"" Burson said. In Burson's view, ""one of the reasons was people were taking their traditional vacations…going to Hawaii, Europe, rather than driving, [or taking] road trips."" And Masha Löfstedt, who owns three rental properties in Oregon, struggled to get her property booked ahead of the holiday season. ""One of our houses that rents out all the time, nobody's booked for this weekend. That's like the first time in years,"" Löfstedt told Yahoo Finance in late 2022.

While I really enjoyed watching Salesforce and C3.ai shares explode higher post earnings last week, hot movers along these lines have been too few and far between (in either direction) in recent weeks. But if you take a step back and level set the stock market today, the muted action kind of makes a great deal of sense. Investors are facing a fresh dilemma — call it paralysis by analysis amid all the incoming data flying in. On the one hand, we have hot retail sales and inflation reports from the government — both calling into question whether the Federal Reserve is moving fast enough to squash inflation. On the other end of the spectrum, the jobs market continues to be solid (as probably seen in this week's jobs report). Yet, when you look at fourth quarter earnings (and conference calls) from Best Buy, Home Depot, Target and other retailers, you will see consumer weakness in big ticket merchandise. Dig into Target's earnings, and you will see a shopper trading down to cheaper private label goods because they are less inflationary and they just got laid off by a tech company. Taken together, this is a confusing time to be an investor – something market maven Keith Lerner at Truist captures in a new note he sent me: ""The recent action is very much aligned with a key market dilemma we have been highlighting: If the economy stays stronger, as we have seen recently, Fed policy is set to remain tighter, and this will weigh on market valuations. Or, instead, if the economy weakens, this will pressure profits. Neither of these outcomes are favorable for premium market valuations."" In other words, Mr. Market doesn't know what he wants! And if you think all the bad news of any kind is priced into stocks, Lerner adds these considerations: ""For perspective, the S&P 500’s forward P/E of 17.6x is still slightly above the 10-year average of 17.2x, and that’s in the context of a high degree of uncertainty around economic growth, inflation, and earnings. Forward earnings estimates are hovering near a 52- week low, and downside risks remain. The 1-year U.S. Treasury yield has jumped above 5% for the first time since 2007, and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which is hovering around 4%, is nearly double the average of the past decade.""

2023-03-04,BTC-USD,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/bankman-fried-flip-phone-limited-153437236.html,"By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sam Bankman-Fried should be allowed while on bail to have a flip phone with no internet capability and a basic laptop with limited functions, but be forbidden from using other electronic communication devices, the U.S. Department of Justice said. The proposal to limit the indicted FTX cryptocurrency exchange founder's communications was filed late on Friday in Manhattan federal court, on behalf of the government and Bankman-Fried's defense team. It requires approval by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who oversees the case. Kaplan had signaled at a Feb. 16 hearing that he might jail the 30-year-old Bankman-Fried for testing the limits of his $250 million bail package by communicating in ways that could not be monitored. The judge said he did not want to set Bankman-Fried ""loose in this garden of electronic devices,"" following accusations that Bankman-Fried tried to contact possible government witnesses and used a virtual private network to watch football. Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty after prosecutors said he stole billions of dollars of FTX customer funds to plug losses at his Alameda Research hedge fund. He faces 12 criminal charges under an indictment made public on Feb. 23. The proposed flip phone or other non-smartphone for Bankman-Fried would be limited to voice calls and SMS text messages. Laptop internet use would be restricted to specified virtual private networks, 23 websites for personal use including news, sports and food delivery, and websites to help Bankman-Fried prepare for his scheduled Oct. 2 trial. Bankman-Fried is living under house arrest with his parents, both Stanford Law School professors, in Palo Alto, California. The parents agreed to submit sworn affidavits that they would not bring other electronic devices into their home or let their son use theirs. They also agreed that each device would carry software that periodically takes videos or photos of the user, which court officers would be allowed to review, the letter said. Bankman-Fried's lawyers did not immediately respond on Saturday to requests for comment. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York and Anirudh Saligrama in Bengaluru; Editing by Daniel Wallis)"
2023-03-03,BTC-USD,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-march-3-2023-133941006.html,"U.S. stocks rallied on Friday, rounding out a big end to the week, while bond yields retreated slightly from their recent march. At the close, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) surged 1.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) increased 1.1%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 2%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note (^TNX) moved back and forth around the key 4% level Friday, eventually settling below the line, after services data showed economic activity expanded in February. Crude oil traded higher, with U.S. benchmark WTI (CL=F) up at $79.71 a barrel. On the economic data side, economic activity in the services sector grew in February for the second consecutive month as the ISM Services PMI came in at 55.1, slightly lower from 55.2 recorded in January and above economist expectations of 54.5. February's ISM Services figures ""suggests activity continues to expand at a reasonably healthy pace, but provides further reason to doubt the idea that there has been a resurgence in growth since the start of the year,"" Andrew Hunter, deputy chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note following the release. The moves come after the Federal Reserve published a semiannual Monetary Policy Report to Congress that details the central bank's plans to hike interest rates as a means to restore price stability. Officials indicated ""that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2% over time,"" the Fed said in its report. Stocks rallied on Thursday, with the S&P 500 trading lower for most of the session before rallying after commentary from Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic. Bostic said he’s still open to raising rates by another quarter percentage point at the central bank’s March meeting. “I let the data guide me,” Bostic told reporters in a press briefing. “If the data continue to come in suggesting the economy is stronger than I had projected, I’ll adjust my policy trajectory.” Bostic, who isn’t a voter on monetary policy this year, wrote an essay on Wednesday calling for the Fed to raise its policy rate by 50 basis points to a range of 5%-5.25% and then keep it there until well into 2024. Fed officials raised the benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point in February, pulling the target to stand in a range of 4.5%-4.75%. Policymakers will be releasing new projections after the central bank’s March 21-22 meeting. In single stock moves, C3.ai (AI) shares surged over 30% Friday after the company posted fiscal third quarter revenue that came at $66.7 million, beating analyst expectations of $64.2 million. Shares of Rivian (RIVN) jumped after the EV maker said on Friday it's keeping to the original production forecast of 50,000 vehicles in 2023. Costco (COST) shares sank 2% after the bulk retailer posted mixed results for the second quarter. Total revenue for its latest quarter was $55.27 billion, slightly below analysts' expectations of $55.58 billion. During the earnings call, the company provided some hopeful news on the inflation front. ChargePoint (CHPT) shares were down Friday after the maker of EV charging stations reported disappointing results and issued softer guidance. Shares of Amazon (AMZN) were up 3% as the company pauses construction on its second quarters in Arlington, Virginia. The move follows the tech giant's announcements of job cuts in the wake of slowing consumer and corporate spending. Marvell Technology (MRVL) stock fell after the company reported mixed results, with earnings in line with expectations but guidance weaker than forecasted. Shares of Meta Platforms (META) surged 6% as the company announced it would slash prices of its Quest Pro virtual-reality headset after the product launch. In the cryptocurrency market, both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) fell as customers pull their funds from crypto bank Silvergate (SI), whose stock plunged more than 57% during the trading session on Thursday. Following the drop in Bitcoin, the pullback is close to 10% and the digital asset was on pace to close below its 50-day moving average for the first time in almost two months, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-02,BTC-USD,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-today-march-2-2023-135533324.html,"Stocks rallied on Thursday with the Dow leading markets higher as results from Salesforce (CRM) lifted the index, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq shook off early losses to finish in the green. At the close on Thursday, the S&P 500 was up 0.76%, the Nasdaq higher by 0.73%, and the blue chip Dow up 1.05%. Rates remained a key focus for investors, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note settling north of 4%, its highest level since November. The rise in yields has come as investors brace for more aggressive action from the Federal Reserve in the coming months as inflation stays elevated and the economy remains strong. On the front end of the Treasury curve, the yield on 2-year notes continued to trade near its highest level since 2007. The 2-year yield, which stood near 4.8% on Thursday, is seen as the best proxy for investor expectations of the Fed's near-term path for interest rates. In single-stock moves, shares of Salesforce rose 11.5% on Thursday as investors cheered the company's latest quarterly report, which saw the embattled Dow member double down on cost-cutting initiatives and shareholder return plans. The stock's opening gap higher of 16% was its largest since Aug. 2020, according to data from Bloomberg. In an interview with Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi late Wednesday, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in reference to the company's efficiency initiatives: ""We have hit the hyper-space button."" The company announced in its quarterly report an increase in its share repurchase authorization to $20 billion, with COO Brian Millham telling investors on a call, ""We're inspecting every part of our business to find opportunities to drive efficiencies and reduce cost of sales, marketing, and G&A."" Salesforce's 11.5% jump, good for jsut over a $19 per share increase in the stock price, added roughly 110 points to the price-weighted Dow's 340 point gain on Thursday. Elsewhere in single-stock moves, shares of troubled bank Silvergate (SI) fell 57% on Thursday after the company delayed the filing of its annual report and said it would likely report losses larger than those previously disclosed. The bank took on several high-profile crypto clients in recent years and has seen its share price collapse by more than 90% in the wake of the failure of FTX, among other crypto bankruptcies. Tesla (TSLA) shares were also in focus on Thursday, falling 5.9% as the electric carmaker held its latest investor day on Wednesday, which revealed few new product details but emphasized the company's push to unlock new efficiencies in its manufacturing and design processes. On the economic data side, the weekly report on initial jobless claims showed 190,000 new filings for unemployment insurance were made last week, the latest sign the labor market remains robust. Though tomorrow marks the first Friday of the month, the February jobs report will not be released until March 10.

2023-03-02,BTC-USD,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/mortgage-rates-surge-closer-to-7-170022384.html,"Mortgage rates jumped higher this week, getting even closer to 7% and crushing homebuyer activity, which hit a 28-year low. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage increased to 6.65% from 6.50% the week prior, according to Freddie Mac. Rates have climbed over a half-point in February, reversing declines since mid-November. The spike in rates is another blow to would-be buyers, who are also facing still-high home prices and a shortage of affordable homes for sale. Sellers also appear to be pulling their listings, rather than cutting prices further to spur interest. “I think the biggest concern is buying into a market that would continue to go down,” Jeff Reynolds, broker at Compass and founder of UrbanCondoSpaces, recently told Yahoo Finance. “In my 18-year career, I have never seen rate moves like we are seeing now.” The volume of applications to purchase a home slid by 6% from one week earlier, the Mortgage Bankers Association’s survey of applications for the week ending Feb. 24 found. Overall, demand was 44% lower than the same week a year ago and has nosedived to a 28-year low. The drop in demand registered this past month is a sign that affordability remains a top concern, according to Redfin Deputy Chief Economist Taylor Marr. “The housing market took two steps forward in December and January, but has taken one step back in February,” Marr said in a statement. “Mortgage rates crept back this month, which is prompting more buyers and sellers to back off.” Another reason for the pullback in demand is rising home prices. The national median list price increased to $415,000 in February, Realtor.com data showed, up from $406,000 in January. While that’s down 7.6% from June’s peak of $449,000 – it still represents a yearly growth rate of 7.8%. That translates to out-of-pocket costs for buyers. According to Realtor.com, the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home is roughly $630 higher than a year ago. That puts the monthly mortgage payment 45.1% higher than a year ago, exceeding rent growth, up 2.9% from a year ago, and inflation, up 6.4%. As rates continue to climb, fewer home sellers are active this year. The number of newly-listed homes for sale declined by 15.9% in February compared with the previous year, Realtor.com data found. That’s a larger rate of decline versus January’s 10.4% decrease, but a small improvement from November and December. Overall, new listings remained 27% below pre-pandemic 2017 to 2019 levels. According to Redfin, existing homeowners don’t want to move because they don’t want to give up their ultra-low mortgage rates. As of February, approximately 85% of mortgage holders have a rate far below 6%. Homeowners may also be hesitant to put their homes on the market due to soft homebuyer demand that’s forcing sellers to cut prices. “We'll find out in the next 30 days if buyers are getting used to higher rates,” Reynolds said, “or if they will stay on the sideline waiting for rates to come back to earth.” Gabriella is a personal finance reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Subscribe Thursday, March 2, 2023 Today's newsletter is by Jared Blikre, a reporter focused on the markets on Yahoo Finance. Follow him on Twitter @SPYJared. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. In 2004, then-Fed chair Ben Bernanke gave a speech titled, ""The Great Moderation."" His thesis: ""One of the most striking features of the economic landscape over the past twenty years or so has been a substantial decline in macroeconomic volatility."" And while the Global Financial Crisis dented this belief, a post-crisis economic recovery and stock market boom brought these ideas back into vogue among many investors who rode a ""stocks only go up"" rally for more than a decade. But with inflation at multi-decade highs and interest rates at their highest levels in over 15 years, some investors are saying that the old investing epoch has come to an end — ushering in a new era where fundamentals matter, traditional savers are rewarded once again, and the volatility that Bernanke said goodbye to is back. In other words, choppier waters might be the new norm for a while. There are a few things that are starkly different about this present business cycle, Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, told Yahoo Finance Live Wednesday. First, there's the hot labor market, despite the white-collar layoffs. Historically, it's the lower-wage workers that are first in line to get cut. ""Yet another thing about this cycle that is just so different relative to past cycles,"" Saunders said. To date, this downturn has been felt mostly at the upper ends of the wealth spectrum, with asset prices like stocks, bonds, and real estate suffering declines. Meanwhile, inflation is a pernicious problem that disproportionately affects lower incomes. But it has not yet become entrenched — at least in the eyes of policy makers. Investors may not know what to think, but Sonders expects the current fog to lift a bit when we get the next batch of quarterly reports in April. But it might not be a clarity worth celebrating. Analysts have already been lowering the bar for the first quarter earnings, and Sonders believes they have a ways to go considering the bond market is signaling the Fed needs to be yet more aggressive. ""One of the factors most highly correlated to corporate earnings is the 10-year [U.S. Treasury] yield, with a lag,"" she says. Sonders believes the 10-year yield is forecasting the Fed will need to keep rates higher for longer, and that ""the path of least resistance for [earnings estimates] is down"" — targeting the first half of this year. Whether or not that near-term pain materializes, Sonders closes the door on the prior epoch of declining rates and volatility, then describes what investors can expect in the years to come. ""I think that the end of the Great Moderation era is very much here ... Gone are the days of cheap access to goods, cheap access to energy, [and] cheap access to labor. I think all three of those ships have sailed,"" she says. Sonders argues that reversing the engine of globalization and reorienting toward regionalism will have profound investing implications over the secular time frame. ""I would therefore expect greater inflation volatility, economic volatility, [and] geopolitical volatility. We're in this era of regionalization and demographic shifts that are pretty painful."" But as painful as these changes are for workers, consumers and investors alike, there are opportunities for investors. Consider that the Fed has finally raised short-term rates — the so-called risk-free rate — to levels that prevailed in decades prior. ""With the return of the risk-free [Treasury] rate, it's brought secular changes, including the fact that fundamentals are reattaching to prices,"" says Sonders. She goes on to explain that the market is no longer skewed so heavily toward mega cap stocks, and that there's hope for stock pickers once again after over a decade of underperformance. ""This has important implications and helps explain why equal-weighted [stock indices] have generally been doing better than [market] cap-weighted [indices] — why active [investing] has been doing better than passive [investing] — or at least is on a more level playing field with passive. And I think those are secular and as important backdrops for investors to think about.""

The bank said its team ""requires additional time to perform analysis, record journal entries related to subsequent events and to complete management’s evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting."" ""The Company is currently analyzing certain regulatory and other inquiries and investigations that are pending with respect to the Company,"" the company added. Silvergate shares have collapsed over the last year as the company's entanglements with several crypto firms — including bankrupt exchange FTX, among others — resulted in deposits falling by more than two-thirds in the fourth quarter of last year. In January, the company laid off 40% of its staff. The company later suspended a dividend paid on preferred shares as it sought to shore up cash. Over the last year, shares of the bank have lost more than 95%. A spokesperson for Silvergate told Yahoo Finance: ""Silvergate is working diligently to file its 10-K as soon as possible and has no further comment at this time."" In Wednesday's notice, the bank said it sold additional debt securities beyond what was previously anticipated in January and February and it expects to record further losses than what was previously disclosed. In January, the company disclosed it took $887 million worth of non-interest losses in the fourth quarter. The sales are primarily to repay ""outstanding advances"" it received from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, Silvergate said. The bank also needs additional time to complete an ""evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting"" being conducted by its third party accounting firm. Citing business and regulatory challenges, the company is weighing how much the changes might affect its ""ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements,"" according to the filing. In late January, a bi-partisan group of U.S. Senators pressed the company to provide answers over whether it was aware its clients FTX misused customer funds. A Reuters report in February said a Silvergate account controlled by Binance.US moved millions of dollars to a company controlled by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. Last week in a joint statement with the Federal Deposit and Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve made a point to highlight the heightened liquidity risks for banks taking on crypto-related clients. As for its own risks, Silvergate cited “heightened regulatory scrutiny of banking institutions that provide products and services to the digital asset industry,"" private litigation, and investigations from congressional inquiries, banking regulators and the Justice Department. Analysts at JPMorgan downgraded the stock to Underweight from Neutral and withdrew their its price target in a note out Thursday, calling the situation ""highly unusual"" and adding: ""The 'run' experienced at Silvergate appears to have been driven by a combination of (1) trust in the overall system being shaken given the collapse of previously trusted players (such as FTX) and (2) short-sellers voicing concerns (primarily on Twitter).""

The seasonally adjusted S&P Global US Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index was revised lower to 47.3 in February, up from 46.9 in January.

Separately, economic activity in the manufacturing sector diminished in February for the fourth consecutive month following a 28-month period of growth, according to the Institute for Supply Management report on business. The data offered a mixed bag. Employment in manufacturing decreased to 49.10 in February from 50.60 in January. New orders rose to 47.0 compared to January's figure of 42.5. Prices paid jumped to 51.3 from January's reading of 44.5. Stocks fell Tuesday, rounding out the last day of a volatile month of February on Wall Street. According to JP Morgan’s trading desk, February’s month-end rebalance drove some weakness in equities and strength in bonds Tuesday afternoon. With February in the rearview, the S&P 500 remains up more than 3% this year, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group. Mega-caps have been a massive driver of the index moves. That said, 20 of the largest stocks in the S&P 500 have accounted for most of the index’s gains. Now, as the calendar turns, March historically sees the S&P 500’s gains in the second half of the month, Bespoke Investment Group noted. The path of the Federal Reserve's rate hikes remains in focus for investors. Two Federal Reserve officials spoke on Wednesday leaned in the move that aggressive interest rate hikes are the path forward to ease inflation. They followed Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, who said on Tuesday it would be a “danger and a mistake for policy makers to rely too heavily on market reactions” and emphasized the importance to “supplement these traditional data with observations on the ground from the real economy.” However, Goolsbee, who will be a voter at this year’s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting, didn’t comment on monetary policy. Since last year, the Fed has sharply raised rates in an effort to cool inflation. But inflation remains sticky. Policymakers will be releasing new projections after the central bank’s March 21-22 meeting. On the housing front, mortgage rates continue to move upward, pushing buyers to the sidelines as the spring housing market is underway. Both purchase and refinance applications slumped last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index. Volume of purchase applications hit a 28-year low, down 44% from a year ago.

2023-03-01,BTC-USD,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/goldman-sachs-tries-to-reset-firm-culture-after-three-unusual-years-171038235.html,"Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon addressed negative headlines surrounding the bank's culture during the company's second-ever investor day on Tuesday. ""I hate the noise,"" Solomon said bluntly. ""I live in the same neighborhood as you all live in and I wish the noise was different."" Various media reports of mass partner exits, coupled with recent Wall Street chatter the bank has lost its way after the failure of its consumer banking project Marcus, have all contributed to unfavorable sentiment. And this coming after the company laid off some 3,200 workers positions, or a little over 6% of its headcount, in January after a challenging 2022. Solomon admitted mistakes were made, telling investors: ""I think we’ve accomplished a lot over the past few years. We got some things right, got some things wrong."" ""I read things in the paper that don’t match what’s happening inside the firm,"" Solomon continued, explaining there were fewer partner transitions in 2022 than any other year going back to 2014. ""The culture of Goldman Sachs is incredibly strong. ...We have an extraordinary group of people working incredibly hard,"" he said. ""We also recognize we've gone through a very unusual period over last 3 years — the pandemic was a very tough thing on a culture like ours."" Goldman Sachs shares, down about 5% over the past month, are trading relatively flat year-to-date — underperforming the S&P 500's 3% gain over that same time period. Solomon went on to note Goldman is a ""human business,"" explaining the firm has made conscious decisions to invest in its culture with leadership spending more time with partners throughout the year to help push a greater sense of community throughout the organization. ""We’re going to continue to invest in our culture. I think it's very good, [but] I do think we've had dramatic shifts,"" he said, once again referencing the pandemic which was quickly followed by an unfavorable macro environment. ""That created more noise, more grumbling than usual."" Overall, ""I feel good about the partnerships [and] the culture, but that doesn't mean we don't have to keep investing,"" he reiterated. Goldman saw a rough end to 2022 with profits down a whopping 69% in Q4 amid a serious decline in deal-making revenues, pressured by a weakening economic backdrop. Following Tuesday's presentation, analyst reaction appeared cautiously optimistic, although questions remain over the path to profitability for its consumer banking unit, otherwise known as platform solutions. Shares of Goldman fell about 4% on Tuesday as the company made its pitch to investors. ""Coming out of the conference, the buzz among investors was whether GS will grow the consumer businesses or sell parts of them. Our interpretation of management's commentary is that both options are on the table,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck wrote in a new note published on Wednesday. Graseck maintained her Equal Weight rating and reiterated a 12-month price target of $332 a share. Graseck added all three business segments, which also includes investment banking and trading along with wealth and asset management, ""have an opportunity to contribute to Y/Y EPS growth as GS targets growth opportunities and gets more efficient."" Goldman reported a net loss of $660 million in its platform solutions unit in the fourth quarter with a full-year net loss settling at $1.67 billion. The company blamed the decline on higher provisions for credit losses, but stressed on Tuesday: ""Profitability is not a strategy. It is a priority and the outcome of a strategy well executed."" Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala told clients Wednesday Goldman's profitability push seemed genuine, writing: ""While investors looking for instant gratification may have been disappointed, we believe that management is on the same page with shareholders in that it appreciates the need to further shrink its consumer exposure ""unlock value"" (specifically, card partnerships and point-of-sale lending)."" Poonawala maintained a Buy rating and reiterated a $384 price target on the stock. Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-01,BTC-USD,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/feds-bostic-kashkari-call-for-higher-rates-after-concerning-inflation-jobs-data-150224928.html,"Two Federal Reserve officials speaking Wednesday said more aggressive interest rate hikes are likely necessary to slow inflation, as is the central bank keeping rates at elevated levels for some time. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said Wednesday he is remaining ""open-minded"" about whether the Fed should raise rates by 25 or 50 basis points at its next policy meeting on March 21-22. Markets currently expect a 25 basis point, or 0.25%, rate increase from the central bank. ""I’m open-minded about whether it's 25 or 50 basis points [at the next meeting],"" Kashkari said during a Q&A at a Sioux Falls Business CEO event. ""What's more important is what we signal in the dot plot."" The Fed will release a new set of economic forecasts and interest rate expectations alongside its March 22 policy statement. Kashkari said in December, he jotted down raising interest rates up to 5.4% and holding rates at that level for an extended period. ""At this point I haven't decided what my dot is, but I would lean towards continuing to raise further that I would continue to push up my policy path."" ""Given the data in the last month — higher inflation than we expected and a strong jobs report — these are concerning data points suggesting we're not making progress as quickly as we'd like,"" Kashkari said. ""At the same time shouldn't overreact to one month of data even if the data is troubling."" Kashkari is a voting member of the FOMC, the Fed committee that sets monetary policy, in 2023. Elsewhere, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said Wednesday he believes the Fed needs to raise its policy rate by 50 basis points, to a range of 5%-5.25%, and hold it at that level until well into 2024. ""We must determine when inflation is irrevocably moving lower,"" Bostic wrote in an essay published Wednesday. ""We're not there yet. That's why I think we need to raise the federal funds rate to between 5-5.25% and leave it there well into 2024. This will allow tighter policy to filter through the economy and ultimately bring aggregate supply and aggregate demand into better balance and thus lower inflation."" Bostic is not a voting member of the FOMC in 2023, but will be a voting member in 2024. Bostic said in order to consider reversing the course of monetary policy, he needs to see a better balance in the job market between labor supply and demand and see broad-based inflation narrow. Bostic noted about half of the goods in the CPI market basket still show inflation rates of 6% or higher. The Fed targets inflation that averages 2%. ""If we are going to get inflation back in the range of our target, the breadth of inflation will have to narrow considerably,"" Bostic wrote. ""When inflation is no longer top of mind, our mission will largely be accomplished. We are clearly not there yet. But I—and the Committee—are committed to doing all we can to ensure that we get there as soon as possible."" Both Bostic and Kashkari noted that while the increase in interest rates has slowed the housing and real estate sectors, they aren’t seeing many signs higher rates are really slowing down the rest of the economy. ""Business contacts tell us activity may well soften, but they don't anticipate a severe deterioration,"" Bostic wrote. ""When businesses think customers will buy less of their product or service in the near and medium term, then they will adjust hiring and investment plans accordingly."" Kashkari said the U.S is not in recession right now pointing to strong job growth, but said whether the Fed can avoid causing a recession with its interest rate hikes to fight inflation — a so-called soft-landing —remains an open question. ""The track record is not good at being able to slow down the economy this much without going a little too far and heading into recession,"" he said. ""[But] typically, when the central bank has caused a recession by raising interest rates, the bounce back can be very fast."" Kashkari said the dynamics in this economic cycle are different given families and states have strong balance sheets and supply chains are getting better. Both Fed officials said the cost of raising rates too much outweighs the costs of raising rates too little, adding the Fed must avoid a 1970s scenario in which the central bank cut rates too soon, causing inflation to re-surge and forcing the Volcker-led Fed to hike rates much higher to ultimately bring down inflation.

Follow him on Twitter @MylesUdland and on LinkedIn. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. U.S. consumers and the executives that Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon talks to have a lot in common — they feel good about today and worse about tomorrow. New data out from The Conference Board on Tuesday showed consumer confidence dipped in February, with the decline entirely driven by expectations. The Conference Board's index fell to 102.9 in February from 106 in January and 109 in December; December's reading was the highest since Sept. 2021. Underneath the surface of this decline, however, was another month where a strong labor market lifted consumers' current expectations while fears about the future loomed. ""The present situation index rose for a third straight month, underpinned by upbeat views on employment and business conditions,"" wrote Gurleen Chadha, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, in a note to clients on Tuesday. ""That index rose 1.7pts to 152.8. The differential between jobs 'plentiful' and jobs 'hard to get' rose to 41.5ppts, the highest since April 2022, indicating that current labor market conditions are still quite tight."" In January, the U.S. economy added a surprising 517,000 jobs while the unemployment rate stood at 3.4%. Meanwhile, speaking at Goldman's second-ever investor day on Tuesday, Solomon said the executives he spends his days speaking with are feeling better about a ""soft landing"" for the economy, but that inflation worries are ""hampering confidence."" ""When I talk to CEOs, they feel more uncertain about the course of inflation as we run through 2023, 2024. ...There's a real belief that inflation will be stickier and harder to moderate than markets now predict,"" Solomon said. The Conference Board's data shows consumers remain pleasantly surprised the soft labor market they'd braced for hasn't materialized just as executives fretting over recession remain similarly relieved. And yet both groups in their own way remain braced for some version of economic impact. It's just not clear that hasn't already happened. We're coming off a year in which the S&P 500 fell 19%, the price of gas in the U.S. hit $5 a gallon, and the inflation rate reached 9.1%. In less than a year, the Fed has raised interest rates 4.5%. The housing market got crushed. And the most popular investing strategy for those saving for retirement endured its worst year on record. All things that have improved in 2023. And if there's one theme that been pervasive in markets and the economy for some time now it's a sense from investors and consumers that the worst is yet to come. Economists at Wells Fargo said in a note consumer confidence data ""pours some cold water on the streak of strong economic data received to start the year."" Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, said Tuesday, ""if consumers drive the economy, the outlook for 2023 is bleak as the consumers expect that the worst is yet to come."" On Tuesday, The Conference Board's Expectations Index stood at 69.7, notable as any reading below 80 is typically consistent with recession, according to the report. This index, however, has been below 80 for 11 of the last 12 months. And we wait for the recession still. Solomon said there is typically a ""4 to 6 quarter lag before people reset their expectations."" The question, then, is in which direction do consumers and businesses need to reset expectations against those held today. And, once they do, will it already be too late?

2023-02-28,BTC-USD,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-february-28-2023-120603661.html,"U.S. stocks fell Tuesday, rounding out the last day of a volatile month of February on Wall Street. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) edged lower by 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined 0.7%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ticked down by 0.1%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked up to 3.92% Tuesday afternoon. The U.S. benchmark WTI crude oil moved higher to trade around $76.94 a barrel. The dollar index was up, trading at $104.92. Stocks closed higher on Monday, fueling a temporary rebound from Wall Street's worst week of the year. All three indexes ended February in the red after an optimistic start to the year in January. Economic data released on Tuesday showed that retail inventories, excluding auto, rose 0.3%, higher than 0.1% expected by economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Meanwhile, wholesale inventories declined 0.4%, below consensus estimates of 0.1%. American consumers felt worse about the economy in February, the Confidence Board reported. The board's Consumer Confidence Index slumped to 102.9 from 106.0, below consensus estimates of 108.5,  Meanwhile, February Chicago PMI dipped to 43.6 from 44.3, also below consensus expectations. “Consumers and businesses are looking for ways to reduce expenses in anticipation of much weaker activity over the rest of the year. The drop in consumer confidence in February aligns with weaker business confidence readings as the Fed’s sharp increase in interest rates start to bite,"" Ben Ayers, Nationwide senior economist, wrote in a statement. Other data showed that home prices fell 0.5% in December, according to data from S&P Corelogic Case-Shiller Index. On a yearly basis, home prices rose 4.6%, lower than analysts' expectations of 4.8%. As inflation still remains sticky, Federal Reserve Governor Philip Jefferson on Monday shot down arguments for raising the central bank’s 2% inflation target and said he is under ""no illusion"" that it's going to be easy to get the inflation rate back down. This week, investors will remain focused on the retail sector. On Tuesday, earnings from Target (TGT) topped analysts' expectations as consumer spending continues to move away from discretionary categories. The retailer’s same-store sales grew by 0.7%, above estimates of a 1.74% decline. The stock rose about 1% on Tuesday. Data from Bespoke Investment Group showed that over the last week, 420 stocks have reported earnings and the percentage of companies lowering guidance is more than double the percentage raising guidance, signaling ""lots of trouble for these smaller-cap companies that report late in the season."" In other single stock moves, Zoom (ZM) shares rose after the company posted better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings, with earnings per share of $1.22 higher than estimates of 80 cents. Revenue came in at $1.12 billion. Occidental Petroleum (OXY) shares moved down on Tuesday after the oil and gas producer posted fourth-quarter results that came in below Wall Street expectations on revenue and earnings per share. Shares of Workday (WDAY) were up after the human-resources software company topped expectations with revenue of $1.65 billion, up 20% year-over-year, against estimates of $1.63 billion. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (AMC) fell jumped on Tuesday after a Delaware court said it would hold a hearing on April 27, which will likely delay the date of conversion of convertible units APE to common stock. Tesla (TSLA) shares fell around 1% as Mexico's president confirmed that the EV maker will build a new plant in Monterrey, Mexico. The Mexican president said more details will be released at Tesla's investor day, and he said the plant is expected to be ""very big."" Shares of Coinbase (COIN) surged as fears of crypto regulation begin to fade. On Monday, the company was served a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission as the regulatory agency cracks down on cryptocurrency listings, its custody of digital assets and platform operations, and more, the company disclosed. Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) shares sank after the company reported a wider-than-expected loss and forecasted disappointing guidance for 2023 as the cruise operator gets squeezed by soaring fuel and labor costs. Separately, Bank of Nova Scotia shares dropped after the Canadian lender reported a missed in earnings estimates as a lull in its investment banking division dented income from its capital markets unit. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. Today the process opens for semiconductor companies to apply for a piece of the $39 billion grant money being allocated as part of the CHIPS and Science Act. But there's a catch: firms that win the funds may not be able to buy back stock – for a while, anyway. “We want to make sure that their money is being used to increase research and development in innovation and not to pad their bottom line or do buybacks,” said Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in an interview with Yahoo Finance. One could argue it’s the administration’s prerogative to decide how chipmakers that accept grants to build factories use that money. But the White House wants to go further, by boosting taxes on buybacks from their current 1%. In his State of the Union address earlier this month, President Joe Biden said that tax should be much higher: ""Corporations ought to do the right thing. That’s why I propose we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks and encourage long-term investments. They’ll still make considerable profit."" That proposal is what may have led Warren Buffett to weigh in on the hot-button issue in the Berkshire Hathaway CEO’s annual letter to investors: “When you are told that all repurchases are harmful to shareholders or to the country, or particularly beneficial to CEOs, you are listening to either an economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue (characters that are not mutually exclusive).” Even Buffett has a caveat, however: he says buybacks make sense only if they are made at “value-accretive prices,” i.e. when corporations don’t overpay. Taking a step back, corporations have a number of ways to spend their money, from building new plants to hiring people to research and development. They can also distribute the funds directly to shareholders by paying out dividends. Or they can repurchase shares, which has the effect of reducing overall share count, automatically increasing earnings per share. (In a simplified example, if a company makes $1 million in profit and has 50,000 shares outstanding, earnings per share are $20. If it buys back 10,000 of its shares, earnings per share go to $25, making an existing shareholder's stake more valuable.) And the numbers are a lot bigger than in the example above. Last year, U.S. companies announced a record $1.223 trillion of buybacks, according to data from EPFR TrimTabs. This year, it’s already running at $274.9 billion — heating up even after the 1% tax kicked in. Eliminating or restricting that tool, then, would be a big deal. Will it actually happen? In the case of companies accepting money as part of the CHIPS Act, it’s unclear whether they’ll be barred from doing buybacks at all, or just directly using the funding they’ve received. (Senator Elizabeth Warren and some of her colleagues in Congress want the participants to be barred from doing buybacks for 10 years). Secretary Raimondo said each case will be different, but the government will in theory have the ability to claw back money in the “most extreme cases” if companies do not comply with their agreements, whether that deals with buybacks or other stipulations. Investors in companies like Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) should take note, since they’re among the firms that have announced plans to build plants in the U.S. and are likely to apply for federal funding. As for whether a broader clampdown on buybacks is coming, policy analyst Ed Mills is skeptical. “Really, what this is about is setting up a strawman, as we get into debates about the debt ceiling,” Mills, a managing director at Raymond James, told Yahoo Finance in an interview. On the one hand, Republicans will fire up their rhetoric about getting the U.S. fiscal house in order. Democrats, led by President Biden, are likely to shoot back by saying Republicans aren’t willing to ask companies enacting big buybacks to pay more in taxes. “I don't think it happens, but I think it's going to be more part of the conversation than I think the market anticipates right now,” Mills said.

The Minneapolis-based retailer saw same-store sales increase by 0.7%, higher than Wall Street estimates of -1.74%. Similar to Walmart's (WMT) latest quarterly results, consumer spending at Target seemed to shift to essentials like food and away from categories like electronics, home, and apparel. Target shares jumped by more than 3.5% in pre-market trading after the report's release. Target CEO Brian Cornell said the team was pleased with the sales growth in what continues to be a ""very challenging environment."" Here's what Target reported, compared to Wall Street estimates, based on Bloomberg consensus data: Revenue: $31.40 billion versus $30.46 billion expected Adjusted earnings per share: $1.89 versus $1.48 expected Same-store sales: 0.7% versus -1.74% expected Brick & mortar same-store sales: up 1.9% versus -2.80% expected Cornell said having multiple category offerings, including food & beverage, in addition to beauty and household items served the retailer well this past quarter, Cornell said. ""Strength in Food & Beverage, Beauty and Household Essentials offset ongoing softness in discretionary categories. This performance highlights the benefit of our multi-category merchandise assortment, which drives relevance with our guests in any environment, and is a key reason we grew traffic every quarter last year."" Same-store sales beat estimates, up 0.7% compared to expectations of a decline of 1.74%. Same-store sales at physical locations also got a boost, up 1.9%, while digital sales dropped 3.6% in Q4. At the end of Q4, inventory was 3% lower than 2021. Meanwhile, in discretionary categories like electronics, home and apparel, inventory was nearly 13% lower than 2021, ""partially offset by higher inventory in frequency categories."" For full-year fiscal 2022 results, revenue grew by $3 billion, to $109 billion. Compared to 2019, revenue is up more than $30 billion. In the full-year, same-store sales increased 2.2%, while traffic was up 2.1%. Looking ahead to fiscal 2023, Cornell said the retailer is focused on it's long-term strategy and ""continued differentiation through affordability, assortment, ease and convenience"" as it competes with other retailers for consumers trading down. ""At the same time, we’re planning our business cautiously in the near term to ensure we remain agile and responsive to the current operating environment...as we plan for the year ahead, we will continue to make robust capital investments and pursue efficiency opportunities in support of our long-term growth."" For the first-quarter of 2023, the company expects a wide range for same-store sales, from a low-single digit decline to a low-single increase, and an operating income margin rate of 4-5%. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.50 to $1.90. For fiscal-year 2023, the company expects same-store sales to be the same, from low-single digit to a low-single increase, along with an operating income of more than $1 billion and adjusted EPS to range from $7.75 to $8.75. In the next 3 years, the company aims to move beyond its pre-pandemic operating income margin rate of 6%, and says it could possibly reach that goal as early as fiscal 2024, ""depending on the speed of recovery for the economy and consumer demand."" — Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-02-27,BTC-USD,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-february-27-2023-130555308.html,"U.S. stocks rose on Monday, fueling a rebound from Wall Street's worst week of the year. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose by 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.2%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased by 0.6%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked down to 3.93% Monday. On the economic data side, new orders for manufactured durable goods in January plunged to 4.5%, the biggest drop since April 2020, the Census Bureau reported. The drop was more pronounced than economist estimates of 4.0%. ""The manufacturing sector will remain under pressure in the months ahead, but the details of January's report of durable goods orders and shipments suggest factory activity started the year on a better note than the headline figure would suggest,"" Lydia Boussour, EY Parthenon senior economist, wrote in a statement following the release. Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors’ index of pending home sales climbed 8.1% to 82.5 in January, sharply higher from the projected rise of 1.0% by Bloomberg economists, according to data the group released on Monday. On a yearly basis, however, pending transactions plunged by nearly 24%. ""The increase in the Pending Home Sales Index confirms that the US housing market has improved, or better put, has somewhat stabilized over the last several months due to lower mortgage interest rates,"" Raymond James chief economist Eugenio Aleman wrote in statement to Yahoo Finance. ""However, the recent increase in mortgage rates is probably going to inflict some more pain on the US housing market going forward."" Stocks closed out their worst week of 2023 on Friday after the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge showed it unexpectedly accelerated in January and consumer spending jumped. The “core” Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index – which excludes volatile food and energy components – showed prices climbed 0.6% in January and 4.7% from last year. The Commerce Department also reported consumer spending rose 1.8% last month from December, the largest increase in nearly two years. The survey’s results renewed anxiety among investors that the Fed would continue its aggressive tightening campaign against inflation. The drop in optimism pressured the major indexes, as the Dow Jones dropped 3% for its fourth consecutive losing week, while the S&P 500 shed 2.7% in its worst week since early December and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.3%. Data compiled by 22V Research has found that rising interest rates have increased the correlation between growth and value stocks to the highest level since at least 2005. This week, investors will remain keen on the retail sector, with earnings from Target (TGT) on deck before market open on Tuesday after Walmart (WMT) warned of cautious profit guidance for the year ahead. Home improvement retail giant Home Depot (HD) also had disappointing guidance for fiscal 2023. Elsewhere on the earnings calendar are results from Costco (COST), Macy's (M), Dollar Tree (DLTR), and Kohl's (KSS) to feature the retail side. Meanwhile, the share of companies topping analysts' expectations in the fourth quarter has been low compared to history. Data from FactSet showed that 68% of S&P 500 companies reported fourth quarter earnings that beat expectations, down from the five-year average of 77% and the 10-year average of 73%. In single stock moves, Seagen Inc. (SGEN) shares jumped Monday morning after a report from The Wall Street Journal said Pfizer (PFE) is in early-stage talks to acquire the cancer drugmaker company in what could be a multi-billion dollar deal. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK-B) stock rose following CEO Warren Buffett’s annual letter to shareholders, which offered readers a glimpse into his views on share buybacks, taxes, corporate accounting, and his sense of optimism about the economy. Shares of fuboTV (FUBO) sank after the sports-focused streaming service issued disappointing guidance in its fourth-quarter earnings report on Monday and disclosed that it had sold stock at a deeply discounted price. Fisker (FSR) shares jumped Monday after the electric vehicle startup announced its deliveries for its first vehicle, the Ocean SUV, would be completed by spring. Shares of Union Pacific (UNP) climbed after the largest freight operator announced its plans to name a new chief executive following pressure from activists to oust Lance Fritz from the job. Bath & Body Works (BBWI) shares fell after the company said in a letter to shareholders that the looming proxy battle is based on ""misguided"" motivations and would be detrimental to shareholders. The board made the decision to not appoint former Third Point co-chief investment officer Munib Islam. Elsewhere, in cryptocurrency news, Coinbase (COIN) said in a tweet that it will soon suspend trading for Binance's stablecoin, Binance USD, on March 13 at or around noon ET. The move comes after Paxos Trust disclosed it will stop creating the Binance-branded stablecoin, citing regulatory pressure. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. Salesforce is facing a defining moment in its 24-year history. Growth is slowing. Analysts are worried fundamentals will get worse before they get better as companies curtail tech spending amid a sluggish global economy. A fresh round of layoffs at Salesforce have just been uncorked....at a company that has only known aggressive hiring. Employees are questioning leadership at the tech titan. Co-CEO Bret Taylor is no longer co-CEO of Salesforce — instead he's off to launch an AI startup the serial entrepreneur tells me. Slack founder Stewart Butterfield, who stayed on when the company was acquired by Salesforce, is still founder...but no longer with the parent company. Salesforce co-founder Marc Benioff is back at the CEO helm, after attempting again to pullback from day to day duties (by delegating to a co-CEO) and focus more on his vast philanthropic ventures. To top it all off the company is staring down the barrel of five sharks in the field of activist money management: Elliott Management, Starboard Value, Inclusive Capital, ValueAct, and Third Point. This is an unprecedented activist versus public company battle, pros have told Yahoo Finance. How it ends is wildly unclear, but is a situation just as important as Wednesday's earnings report. ""While the involvement of five activist investors has likely been the primary driver of CRM stock of late, quarterly results probably still matter (though not as much as usual), and how those results are delivered may be more relevant than ever,"" said Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci. Below, Yahoo Finance breaks down this complicated situation at large-cap tech name Salesforce. The drama is high, and it could all be coming down to one final epic conclusion. What Yahoo Finance Is Watching: Salesforce Earnings What sources tell us is top of mind on the Street: How quickly are sales deteriorating inside of the broader tech pullback? What does the pipeline of future business look like? Does Marc Benioff acknowledge the activist situation? Are more layoffs needed? Consensus is that Salesforce warns on sales and earnings for 2023 – but how bad is it? The Vibe Among Wall Street Analysts Analysts are generally expecting a muted tone from Salesforce on earnings day. “For Benioff and Salesforce the actual quarter and FY24 take a back seat to the fluid activist situation which is happening at Salesforce with the Street's patience wearing thin after a head scratcher Slack deal and slowing growth/underachieving margins front and center.” -Wedbush analyst Dan Ives ""Key to the Q4 call is gaining clarity on the extent to which management will turn the dial up on non-GAAP operating margins, GAAP profitability, and any future share repurchases with the emergence of activist involvement in the stock."" -Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss What the Activists Want From Salesforce Sources tell Yahoo Finance that Starboard Value — led by veteran activist investor and Papa John's chairman Jeff Smith — has been disappointed in Salesforce’s expense management, but isn’t advocating for a sale of Slack. Other activists involved in the situation are keen to see a Slack sale even at a low price as a show of faith by management they will improve margins, sources say. Overall, we are told the activists are entrenched and want clear changes from Salesforce leadership. Key thing the activist pool wants: Higher profit margins Realistic 2023 guidance Clear succession plan from CEO co-founder Marc Benioff Like we said, this earnings report is a defining moment in the history of Salesforce.

2023-02-26,BTC-USD,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stocks-under-pressure-retail-earnings-continue-what-to-know-this-week-142308388.html,"The 2023 stock market rally is under pressure. Inflation data last week that topped expectations — as well as a continued drop in optimism the Federal Reserve's rate hikes will end sooner rather than later — pressured the major indexes with the Dow logging a fourth-straight losing week and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq suffering their worst weeks of the year, losing 2.7% and 3.4%, respectively. The Dow endured its worst weekly performance since Sept. 2022. In the week ahead, investors will remain keyed in on the retail sector, with results from Target (TGT) in focus after rival Walmart (WMT) issued a warning on the state of U.S. consumers last week. On the economic data side, a crowded calendar of reports from the housing and manufacturing sectors — two areas of the economy which have most reflected the impact of policy tightening — is on tap along with a key measure of consumer confidence. On Friday, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index — the Fed's preferred assessment of how quickly prices are rising across the economy — showed prices rose 0.6% during the month of January and 5.4% over last year. On a ""core"" basis, which strips out volatile food and energy components, prices rose 0.6% for the month and at an annual clip of 4.7%. The week marked a turning point in sentiment around inflation expectations and the path forward for interest rates. The hotter-than-expected PCE index followed upside surprises to inflation this year from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and producer prices, which showed the largest increases in several months to start the year. ""The bear market rally that began in October from reasonable prices and low expectations has morphed into a speculative frenzy based on a Fed pause/pivot that isn't coming,"" Morgan Stanley's top strategist Mike Wilson said in a note to clients last week. Wilson's forecast sees the S&P 500 bottoming out at 3,000 this year. On Friday, the benchmark U.S. equity index closed at 3,970. ""Investor optimism had already been hit by a slow puncture this week but it's deflating more rapidly as the latest data indicates that the work in taming inflation is far from over,"" Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in a note. Standout economic data releases in the week ahead include the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index, ISM's manufacturing PMI, and The Conference Board's consumer confidence reading for February. On the corporate side, Target will release its fourth-quarter earnings results before market open on Tuesday with results from Costco (COST), Macy's (M), Dollar Tree (DLTR), and Kohl's (KSS) also featuring on the retail side. Last week, Walmart's CFO John David Rainey said the ""consumer is still very pressured, and if you look at economic indicators, balance sheets are running thinner and savings rates are declining relative to previous periods."" ""We expect Target's results will look similar to Walmart's, with better-than-expected sales, more gross margin pressure than predicted, and solid opex leverage in the store,"" Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe said in a note. Tarlowe warned, however, Target is not ""immune to consumer spending trends shifting to the more needs-based items and away from higher-priced and higher-margin discretionary categories."" Elsewhere on the earnings calendar, notable reports include Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Zoom Video (ZM), AMC Entertainment (AMC), Rivian Automotive (RIVN), and Dell (DELL) among others. — Monday: Durable Goods Orders, January Preliminary (-3.8% expected, 5.6% during prior month); Durables Excluding Transportation, January Preliminary (0.1% expected, -0.2% during prior month); Non-defense Capital Goods Orders Excluding Aircraft, January Preliminary (0.0% expected, -0.1% during prior month); Non-defense Capital Goods Shipments Excluding Aircraft, January Preliminary (-0.6% during prior month); Pending Home Sales, month-over-month, January (1.0% expected, 2.5% during prior month); Pending Home Sales NSA, year-over-year, January (-34.3% during prior month); Dallas Fed Manufacturing Activity, February (-9.10 expected, -8.4 during prior month) Tuesday: Advance Goods Trade Balance, January (-$91.0 billion expected, -$90.3 billion during prior month, revised to -$89.7 billion); Wholesale Inventories, month-over-month, January Preliminary (0.1% expected, 0.1% during previous month); Retail Inventories, month-over-month, January (0.5% during prior month); House Price Purchase Index, quarter-over-quarter, Q4 (0.1% during prior quarter); FHFA Housing Pricing Index, December (-0.1% during prior month); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City Composite, month-over-month, December (-0.54% during prior month); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City Composite, year-over-year, December (6.77% during prior month); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, year-over-year, December (7.69% during prior month); MNI Chicago PMI, February (44.3 during prior month); Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index, February (-11 during prior month); Conference Board Consumer Confidence, February (108.5 expected, 107.1 during prior month); Richmond Fed Business Conditions, February (-10 during prior month); Dallas Fed Services Activity, February (-15.0 during prior month) Wednesday: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Feb. 24 (-13.3% during prior week); S&P Global U.S. Manufacturing PMI, February Final (47.8 prior); Construction Spending, month-over-month, January (0.4% expected, -0.4% during prior month); ISM Manufacturing, February (47.9 expected, 47.4 during prior month); ISM Prices Paid, February (44.5 during prior month); ISM Employment, February (50.6 during prior month); ISM New Orders, February (42.5 during prior month); Wards Total Vehicle Sales, February (15.00 million, 15.74 million during prior month) Thursday: Unit Labor Costs, Q4 Final (2.5% expected, 3.0% during prior quarter); Nonfarm Productivity, Q4 Final (1.5% expected, 1.1% during prior quarter); Initial Jobless Claims, week ended Feb. 24 (TK expected, 192,000 during prior week); Continuing Claims, week ended Feb. 18 (1.654 million during prior week) Friday: S&P Global U.S. Services PMI, February Final (50.5 during prior month); S&P Global U.S. Services Composite PMI, February Final (50.2 during prior month); ISM Services Index, February (54.5 expected, 55.2 during prior month) — Monday: Groupon (GRPN), LendingTree (TREE), Li Auto (LI), Lordstown Motors (RIDE), Oak Street Health (OSH), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Workday (WDAY), Zoom Video (ZM) Tuesday: AMC Entertainment (AMC), AutoZone (AZO), Cracker Barrel (CBRL), Compass (COMP), Duolingo (DUOL), GoodRx (GDRX), HP (HP), J.M.

2023-02-24,BTC-USD,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-today-february-24-2023-104349492.html,"U.S. stocks tumbled Friday after the Federal Reserve's most closely watched inflation measure came in stronger than expected, in another sign that price pressures have become sticky into 2023. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) sank 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) plopped more than 300 points, or 1%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid 1.7%. Friday marked the worst week for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq since December. U.S. Treasury yields scrambled higher following the reading. The 2-year note surged 12 basis points to 4.81% while the 10-year note gained 7 basis points to top 3.95%. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index — the Fed's preferred assessment of how quickly prices are rising across the economy — rose 0.6% in January and 5.4% from last year. On a ""core"" basis, which strips out volatile food and energy components, prices rose 0.6% for the month and 4.7% from last year. The report from the Commerce Department also showed that consumer spending rose 1.8% last month from December after falling the previous month. The numbers support recent indications inflation is not falling at the pace and extent investors have been hoping for, even as prices have stabilized from the peaks of the current inflation cycle. “First December CPI was revised higher, and now each reading for January surprised to the upside. Inflation’s like an old boyfriend or girlfriend that keeps showing up when you don’t want to see them,"" David Russell, Vice President of Market Intelligence at TradeStation said in a note. In individual stock moves, Block (SQ) rose 4.3% after the payments processor reported fourth-quarter financial results that saw profit and revenue top expectations. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) shares fell 1% after the media giant posted a big revenue loss for the final three months of the year. Boeing (BA) shares closed down 4.8% after the airline manufacturer said it paused deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner jets because of a documentation issue. Beyond Meat's (BYND) stock rallied 10% after better-than-expected earnings and CEO Ethan Brown said the company is seeing progress in its efforts to cut costs and manufacturing hurdles. Beleaguered used car retailer (CVNA) plunged 20.5% after reporting a net loss that was nine times wider in the fourth quarter. The bumpier-than-anticipated road to restoring price stability and strong economic data to start the year — nonfarm payrolls rose by 517,000 in January while retail sales surged 3% — have prompted investors to readjust expectations around the path forward for interest rates, putting a dent in the market's recent momentum. The S&P 500 snapped a four-day losing streak on Thursday as stocks closed higher. But earlier this week on Tuesday, stocks had their worst day of the year. ""Equity bulls and even Chair Powell have bragged about anchored expectations for inflation and how consumers and investors believe it is moving in the right direction,"" Morgan Stanley Chief Investment Officer Lisa Shalett said in a note earlier this week, noting that January's Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) raised questions about whether inflation progress is stalling. ""Given data crosscurrents, the central bank needs to tread carefully. Investors still wagering on a 'Fed put; or quick return to financial repression are apt to be wrong this time,"" Shalett said. ""Fed credibility is on the line, and it is likely to risk overshooting rather than quitting the inflation fight too early."" — Alexandra Semenova is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-02-24,BTC-USD,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/fed-inflation-fight-longer-pce-index-173353572.html,"Two Federal Reserve officials suggested Friday morning that inflation could persist longer than thought after the central bank's most closely watched inflation gauge surged by the most in months. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Fed Governor Philip Jefferson said they remain concerned about an inflation rate that remains well above the Fed's 2% year-over-year target. Mester reiterated that while inflation has moderated, the overall level remains too high. She noted recent research from the Cleveland Fed and a discussion paper that have suggested inflation could be more persistent than currently anticipated. “I see the risks to the inflation forecast as tilted to the upside and the costs of continued high inflation as being significant,” Mester said at the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum in New York. “So in my view, at this point, with the labor market still strong, the costs of undershooting on policy or prematurely loosening policy still outweigh the costs of overshooting.” The comments came as the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation – the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index – unexpectedly accelerated in January, rising 5.4% last month on an annual basis. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the inflation gage rose 4.7%, both marking pickups after several months of declines. On a monthly basis, the PCE index rose 0.6% in January compared with December. Core prices also rose 0.6% in January from the prior month, compared with December’s 0.4% increase. The numbers Friday came a week after the government released the Consumer Price Index, which showed a similar pickup in the inflation rate. The hot read on inflation hit markets on renewed rate hike fears, with the Dow Jones Industrial average tanking 336 points. ""By betting on a terminal rate above 5.35%, the market is effectively betting that the recent momentum in both growth and inflation will be sustained through the summer,"" Jefferies chief economist Aneta Markowska said. Mester, who does not vote on monetary policy decisions this year, told Bloomberg in an interview Friday morning that the latest inflation reading shows the Fed needs to keep raising interest rates but stopped short of suggesting it required a 50-basis-point rate hike at the next policy meeting in March. Mester said last week she wanted to raise the benchmark policy rate by 50 basis points at the last policy meeting to try to get to the peak rate faster, though she also didn't want to surprise markets. In a separate interview Friday morning with CNBC, Mester signaled her forecast in December to raise rates a bit above 5% hasn’t changed much. Speaking at the same Monetary Policy Forum on Friday, Boston Fed President Susan Collins said inflation is still too high and that the Fed has more work to do. “Inflation remains too high, and recent data …all reinforce my view that we have more work to do, to bring inflation down to the 2 percent target,” said Collins. “I anticipate further rate increases to reach a sufficiently restrictive level, then holding there for some, perhaps extended, time.” Also speaking at the conference, Jefferson said a limited supply of workers for jobs needed, which has pushed up wages, suggests inflation may cool slowly. “The ongoing imbalance between the supply and demand for labor, combined with the large share of labor costs in the services sector, suggests that high inflation may come down only slowly,” he said. Jefferson also said the forces driving inflation now are different that past inflationary episodes and therefore economic models won’t be as helpful to policymakers. Jefferson said the current situation is different because the pandemic created unprecedented disruptions to global supply chains and is having a long-lasting impact on the labor participation rate. “The inflationary forces impinging on the U.S. economy at present represent a complex mixture of temporary and more long-lasting elements that defy simple, parsimonious explanation,” he said. Jefferson says he thinks the Fed is addressing the spike in inflation proactively, unlike in the 1970s and has more credibility now.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. What's old may be new again for U.S. stock investors. The end of zero-interest rate policies (ZIRP) is likely to mark a shift in equity market favorites from long-leading technology names to sectors like energy, materials and housing — or what strategists at Bank of America deem part of ""the old economy."" ""Bear markets have historically resulted in leadership change, which suggests old economy sectors are likely the winners of this cycle,"" Savita Subramanian, BofA’s head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy said in a note earlier this week. With these components of the market depleted of capital over the past ten years as Big Tech was powered by free money, the ""pendulum is expected to swing back"" in their direction, Subramanian noted. Despite the big gains across January in these very stocks that were battered throughout 2022, investors have called the moves higher this year a bear market rally rather than the start of a new bull market. ""I think the stock market is in a protracted bear market,"" DoubleLine Capital founder and CEO Jeffrey Gundlach told Yahoo Finance Live in an interview Wednesday (video above), adding it began in the fourth quarter of 2021. ""[It's] very negative for the stock market when you have rising interest rates against these valuations, especially real interest rates,"" Gundlach said, adding a pause in the increase in real rates this fall was a catalyst for the recovery in risk assets. ""But it looks like real interest rates might start rising again."" Meanwhile on Sunday, Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson told clients in a not that the recent rally was ""a speculative frenzy"" based on false hopes for a pivot by the Federal Reserve. Equity markets are in the throes of a recent shift in the narrative for where interest rates will go, finally taking Fed officials at face value as they vow to lift their policy rate above 5% this year. Bank of America indicated its analysis of equity risk premium shows growth stocks were not pricing in recession risk and the expected higher-for-longer rate environment is projected to pressure long-duration growth stocks. Whatever the rest of the year holds for the U.S. stock market, signs have already emerged of an imminent change in leadership. Last year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average crushed the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite, for example, falling less than 10% in 2022 while the latter index wiped out more than one third of its value. As Yahoo Finance’s Jared Blikre pointed out, the Dow’s outperformance relative to the tech index was by far the biggest gap since the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. Goldman Sachs’s chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin warned in November that the ""exceptionalism of technology is arguably behind us. In 2022, the aggregate market capitalization of the current ""tetrad of largest stocks,"" as Goldman Sachs put it — Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) – fell to 18% from 22% the prior year. And those top four stocks lost an aggregate -25% compared to -13% for the remaining stocks in the index during the period. ""With the end of ZIRP, we see the pendulum swinging back to the old economy as prolonged underinvestment has led to supply issues in the old economy,"" Subramanian said. Bank of America itself raised metals to overweight, and is overweight energy, a testament to its confidence in the leadership transition.

Crypto investors and businesses are grappling with what the liquidation of Silvergate Capital (SI), a crucial U.S. banking partner, could mean for the crypto asset class’ access to dollars. ""It won’t be a smooth transition for the industry at all,"" Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, told Yahoo Finance. Silvergate offered a payments network that allowed customers to exchange U.S. dollars between accounts 24/7 to match the liquidity needs of the crypto market. The bank suspended the offering last Friday. The other most amenable bank to crypto firms, Signature Bank (SBNY), is also actively reducing its exposure to digital asset business. ""If small banks such as Customers and Pathward (formerly MetaBank) don’t step in to fill the gap, other alternatives include the Euro and non-dollar backed stablecoins, Conor Ryder,"" an analyst for Kaiko said Thursday. ""It's a blow to the ecosystem but its unlikely to be a permanent one,"" Acheson added. Crypto markets were also under pressure Thursday as broader financial stresses in the banking sector emerged amid new challenges as Silicon Valley Bank, news which sent shares of its parent company SVB Financial down 60% on Thursday as the benchmark S&P 500 fell some 1.8%. Elsewhere, the Biden Administration is proposing to raise $24 billion for the U.S. government by closing a tax loophole. The loophole allows investors to harvest their crypto losses to offset capital gains and income for individuals. ""As other countries are bringing crypto safely into the regulatory perimeter, we should be doing the same,"" said Paul Grewal, Coinbase's chief legal officer, before a U.S. House Financial Services Committee Thursday afternoon. Largest among U.S. crypto firms, Coinbase (COIN) has several banking partners and is not as immediate a risk from Silvergate’s liquidation as smaller startups given the exchange ended business with the firm last week. Even so, CFRA Research has chosen to maintain its hold rating on shares of Coinbase at neutral. ""Although COIN has more measured exposure directly to SI, indirect impacts around the health of like-kind clients and/or general investor enthusiasm (i.e., trading activity) could also create an overhang on COIN's fundamentals,"" CFRA analyst David Holt said in a Thursday note. Shares of Coinbase fell 7.8% Thursday to $58. They traded more than 1% lower during Friday's pre-market session. The Office of the New York Attorney General is also suing KuCoin, the fourth largest crypto exchange by trading volume for failing to register as a securities and commodities broker-dealer ""My office is taking action against cryptocurrency companies that are brazenly disregarding our laws and putting investors at risk,” Attorney General Letita James said in the release.

The new provision would raise $24 billion, according to the White House. Currently, crypto sales aren’t subject to the same rules that investors in stocks or bonds have to follow. Investors can sell crypto investments at a loss, take the tax-deductible loss to reduce their tax burden, and buy right back into the same investment. The budget eliminates this and subjects crypto to the same so-called wash-sale rules that apply to stocks and bonds. House Democrats proposed legislation last Congress to close the tax loophole, by imposing the ""wash sale"" rules on commodities, currencies, and digital assets. The IRS treats crypto as property, not as a security, which is how the asset class escapes these rules. President Biden already passed a crypto-related tax provision that was tucked in his 2021 infrastructure act, causing an uproar from the industry. The law defined a cryptocurrency ""broker"" broadly, allowing the Internal Revenue Service to target crypto miners, developers, and others who could be considered brokers even if they don't have any customers or have access to information needed to comply with tax reporting requirements. The Treasury Department later clarified that miners, validators, and other crypto users will not be classified as crypto ""brokers"" under tax reporting rules. Biden's proposal comes as Federal Reserve Vice Chair of Supervision Michael Barr emphasized in a speech Thursday at the Peterson Institute in Washington that the same regulations that safeguard banks should apply to crypto if the activity is analogous without squashing innovation, while warning banks to tread carefully in the crypto space. The Federal Reserve, the FDIC,and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency last month encouraged banks that use funding from crypto firms to monitor liquidity and maintain strong risk management practices to prevent runs. The warnings come just as Silvergate Capital, one of the crypto market's top banks, became the first crypto bank to fail after feeling ripples from FTX's collapse that caused billions in deposit withdrawals. ""Like everyone else we've been watching what’s been happening in the crypto space and what we see is quite a lot of turmoil, we see fraud, we see a lack of transparency, we see run risk, we see lots of things like that,"" Powell told lawmakers earlier this week. ""What we've been doing is making sure that the regulated financial institutions that we supervise and regulate are careful and taking great care in the ways they engage with the whole crypto space.""

Hiring at 311,000 jobs last month outstripped expectations of 250,000. But wage growth slowed, tempering rate-hike expectations. US stocks fell Friday as investors assessed the February jobs report that showed hiring was still hot in America but wage growth had slowed, curbing expectations the Federal Reserve will upsize its upcoming interest rate hike. The Labor Department said the US economy added 311,000 jobs last month. That trounced expectations of 205,000 in a Bloomberg survey of economists. There also was a downward revision in the massive January print, to 504,00 from the initial 517,000 reading. Wage growth in February was 0.2%, slower than expectations of 0.3% and January's 0.5% pace. Also, the unemployment rate rose to 3.6% from 3.4%.

""Given Fed Chair [Jerome] Powell's fear of higher wages causing inflation, this should calm that fear."" Powell's congressional testimony this week spurred expectations the Fed would speed up rate increases at its March 21-22 meeting from 25 basis points at its previous meeting. Meanwhile, the banking industry remained in focus Friday after shares of Silicon Valley Bank, a prominent lender to tech startups, plunged. The bank said higher interest rates spurred billions in losses on a $21 billion bond portfolio. CNBC reported Friday the lender was in talks to sell itself after fundraising attempts fell short.

2023-03-10,BTC-USD,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/chain-liquidations-beckon-ether-slumps-142804874.html,"Several on-chain positions are at risk of being liquidated following ether's (ETH) plunge to a two-month low of $1,373. A $9.2 million position on MakerDAO will get liquidated at $1,367, while a $29.6 million position on decentralized-finance (DeFi) lender Compound will get liquidated by the protocol's smart contract at $1,241, according to DefiLlama data. On-chain liquidations occur when the value of collateral added by a user borrowing an asset slumps, and the user is then required to add more margin to avoid the collateral being liquidated. Conversely, the user will also risk liquidation if the value of the borrowed asset rises beyond borrowing capacity. CoinDesk reported on Thursday that $300 million in derivatives positions on centralized exchanges had been liquidated and that number has now increased to $400 million according to CoinGlass. On decentralized exchanges and lending protocols, meanwhile, a total of $119.3 million is at risk of liquidation if the price of ether slumps by another 20%. Ether is trading 18% lower than its February high of $1,745 and 71% lower than its record high of $4,876 in November 2021. A slide in stocks, coupled with a regulatory clampdown on crypto, has sent the price of crypto assets spiraling.

2023-03-09,BTC-USD,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/most-nft-industry-working-recycled-160100809.html,"Little of the non-fungible-token (NFT) industry’s market capitalization can be attributed to new investors, according to Randy Wasinger, co-chief executive officer of Forkast Labs and the founder of NFT and blockchain data analytics service CryptoSlam. Forkast.News and CryptoSlam merged in January to form Forkast Labs, a media intelligence platform for the digital economy. Forkast Labs launched its flagship Forkast 500 NFT Index this week to provide data and pricing free of the “noise” that afflicts the industry. The Forkast Ethereum NFT Composite and the Forkast Solana NFT Composite were launched at the same time. In an interview with Forkast’s Pradipta Mukherjee, Wasinger says filtering out wash trading is key to determining the true value of digital assets. Wash trading refers to the buying and selling of financial instruments by the same individuals or groups at the same time to create a distorted picture of prices and investor interest. The following Q&A has been edited for clarity and length. Pradipta Mukherjee: What is your personal reason to create index measurements for this NFT market? Randy Wasinger: It’s something I’ve wanted to do for a long time because I want to know if the market is up or down today and over the last seven days, and if so, then by how much. We know these things for the traditional markets. We know if the stock market is up or down. In currency markets, we know if Bitcoin is up or down. If the U.S. dollar versus some other currency, if it’s up or down. We know that and we know that in real time. But in the digital economy, outside of currencies, we don’t know. So all of these other digital assets are trading and there’s fragmented data points out there that tell us, well, maybe this [NFT] collection is up, and this collection is down. But getting that macro sense of what the market is doing at any given point in time, we don’t know, until now. You can only do it the right way if you’ve got the wide comprehensive data set that we do. From my perspective, it would have to be a multi-chain approach. We can’t just focus on Ethereum or any other chain to get that widest, most comprehensive view of the entire digital economy. Mukherjee: We read reports on massive “wash trading” related to the OpenSea and Blur marketplace competition. How can the industry rely on data when it can be manipulated? Wasinger: That’s where we come in, where you need that trusted, independent, third-party to make sure what you’re looking at is legitimate. We’ve proven over the past months and years that we’re always at the forefront of identifying wash trading. We were the first to wash out the artificial trades happening on LooksRare a little over a year ago and now everybody does that. And similarly, we were the first ones to wash out a lot of the artificial or all of the artificial activity occurring on the Blur marketplace right now. Mukherjee: What is Forkast Labs doing to produce noise-free, clean data that can paint a valid picture of what is taking place in the NFT industry? Wasinger: With CryptoSlam, since 2018, we’ve been dedicated to ingesting any and all NFT data off the blockchain. And so by that definition, any data off the blockchain is theoretically clean. But is it appropriate to be used in an index? Can we rely on it? So what we do is we take all the data off the blockchain for all the blockchains we support, and we ingest it, and then we algorithmically determine whether or not those transactions, those sales were, for lack of a better term, legitimate. So we filter out wash sales. From that perspective, determining index values, we want to know what these assets have traded for in the past. And so we want to make sure that those on-chain data points are as reliable as possible. And to do that, you’ve got to remove wash sales. And that’s the biggest one – to make sure that sales that we record are arm’s-length transactions between a buyer and a seller and we remove everything else. And it’s literally billions of dollars of NFT transactions that we have washed out or cleaned out of our data set and all of that from a CryptoSlam perspective. All of that empowers the CryptoSlam product, but it all powers and flows into the Forkast 500 as well. Mukherjee: What is the current state of the NFT market as we understand through market cap or sales volume? And what different story is the Forkast 500 telling us? Wasinger: I don’t feel like market cap alone is a strong enough indicator. It tells you something but any sort of data point that relies on market cap alone is going to be dominated by a few players. Namely, the one I’ll throw out there is Yuga Labs. So any sort of tracker that tracks the movement of market cap [would basically say] how Yuga is doing today. Much like with the cryptocurrency market cap, it’s dominated by Bitcoin and to a lesser extent Ethereum. [You want to] see if the currency market is going up or down, but what you’re seeing is if Bitcoin or Ethereum is going up or down. That’s not that bad from a currency perspective because a wide variety of people participate in those currencies. But in the NFT landscape, it’s different. For instance, Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks. Those are very expensive assets, and certainly, people own them, but it’s whales that own them just because of how expensive they are. [Whale refers to an entity or an individual that holds large amounts of crypto-related assets.] So if those assets move up or down, this is what the whales are experiencing in their own microeconomy. But it’s not necessarily indicative of the macroeconomy. So what the Forkast 500 does, it certainly includes market cap as part of its algorithm, but it’s not dominated by that. It looks at many other factors, including how many people [and] how many traders are participating in a project. That gives a wider, more representative indicator of what the entire economy is experiencing, and not just a group of whales. Sales volume is certainly important. CryptoSlam has been the pioneer in reporting sales volume from a multi-chain perspective. So it’s certainly important, but it can and will tell a different story because volume just tells you how much interest there is in a project, but it doesn’t necessarily tell you what the value is. That’s why the Forkast 500 is stronger in reporting. You need not ignore sales volume, but you need to look at sales volume in conjunction with the index values, which measures not hype and activity, but actual value. Mukherjee: The crypto industry still has that black eye from the series of unfortunate events of 2022. So why are you launching such an index now when trust in crypto is damaged? Wasinger: Well, we’re launching it now because the industry needs it now. It has needed it for a while. We are literally taking billions of on-chain data points to create these indices. So it’s pretty complex how it all rolls up into this number that updates in real time. We’ve been working on this for a while. We envision this index being used not just within the industry but outside the industry so that non-participants in the digital economy can understand what’s going on, and they can, over time, get that trust that this is somewhere they want to participate. The timing is great for us because of the combination with Forkast where we’re able to reach a much bigger set of users. And ultimately we feel everybody’s going to benefit from it. But new users who aren’t participating in the digital economy now, but are participating in traditional finance, have got their eyes on NFTs and blockchain and crypto, and these [indexes] are what they’re going to use and what they’re going to look at to determine what’s going on. So we’re in a stronger position for that now than we would have been before the merger with Forkast. Mukherjee: Tell us about the evolution of NFTs from art and collectibles to other use cases such as verification of documents and data storage, or the broader use case. Wasinger: I got into NFTs due to the collectibles use case. Since then, we’ve seen collectibles and derivations of that largely dominate. You could argue that art falls into the collectibles category as well. The industry is still trying to figure out how to best use this technology. There’s been lots of experimentation on other use cases, but to date, we really haven’t seen that killer application, outside of something tied to collectibles, that’s bringing in a significant number of new users into the market. As gaming assets, Axie Infinity in particular brought a lot of new entrants into the market, but the play-to-earn model proved to be not a model that would stand the test of time. Gaming has got off to a decent start but still has a long way to go as far as delivering better products that are going to bring in more mainstream gamers is concerned. There is still a gap and we need that gap to close and to have some really, really killer applications, whether it be from gaming or somewhere else, to bring new entrants into the digital economy. Similarly, with other use cases, there’s been lots of experimentation, but the industry needs additional breakthroughs. Mukherjee: Are there plans to expand beyond NFTs? Wasinger: NFTs as tokenized assets are the future of the digital economy. That is our strength. It’s where we are market leaders. As we expand our suite of indices, there will also be an emphasis on currencies at some point as well. Mukherjee: The NFT industry seems to have a lot of the same liquidity flowing into the most trending collections. How much of the same liquidity is being recycled? Wasinger: Right now, I would say most of it. For it not to be recycled, one of two things has to happen. Number one, existing participants in the digital economy need to be buying more crypto from their Coinbase wallet and using that to buy NFTs, but largely we don’t necessarily see that happening like we used to. So either that has to happen, or new people have to come in. This is not to say they’re not coming in, but they’re not coming in like they were in 2021 and early 2022. So without either one of those happening, it is largely recycled liquidity and that’s why you see the market is going down — because it is just recycled liquidity. Mukherjee: How much of the NFT industry’s market capitalization can be attributed to new investors? Wasinger: I would say very little. For instance, Mocaverse, [the membership NFT collection from Web3 venture capital and game developer Animoca Brands], seems like it’s been a successful mint so far. I don’t know what the market cap would be for that, but it’s a lot. It’s going to be tens or hundreds of millions at this point. Now, where did that market cap come from? It was not people opening up their Coinbase accounts and interjecting new cash into it or it wasn’t people coming in from the sidelines. What was happening was what everybody does, which is they’ll just sell their other NFTs or perhaps their other crypto, and then they’ll go and move it into the next project. Mukherjee: Is the market cap of an NFT collection significant? Wasinger: It’s an important number to look at, but only in conjunction with other metrics. So it’s not the end all, be all. If something has a US$100 million market cap, is that what it’s worth? No. In an extreme example, let’s say you owned all of those tokens, the market cap supposedly says US$100 million, and you start selling them. You’re not going to end up with US$100 million. You’re going to end up with something significantly less than that. And what that is, we don’t necessarily know because the laws of supply and demand will take over. It’s an interesting indicator, but it could be misleading as well because there’s certainly not US$100 million worth of value in an NFT project with a US$100 million market cap. You start selling; the price is going to tank."

Crypto prices followed equities lower as U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell this week warned interest rates may need to go higher than expected to curb inflation. The insolvency of crypto bank Silvergate on Wednesday added more downward pressure to crypto prices. Shiba Inu led the losers. Another negative is the increasingly public conflict between U.S. regulators on whether to define crypto assets as securities or commodities. See related article: CFTC chair calls Ethereum a commodity, in contrast to SEC chair Gensler’s position Bitcoin slid 7.41% in the past 24 hours to US$20,127 as of 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data, reaching a low for the month. The price of the largest cryptocurrency has fallen 14.10% in the past seven days, but is still up over 20% from the start of the year.  Ether fell 7.17% to US$1,426, posting a weekly loss of 13.25%. Shiba Inu lost 8.89% in the 24 hours for a seven-day loss of 16.94%. Litecoin replaced the meme token as the 10th largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrency but did not fare much better, falling 8.67% to US$75.63, for a loss of 20.35% for the past week. Silvergate Bank said on Wednesday that the U.S.-based crypto financial services company will liquidate, triggering a price slump that has wiped out over US$60 billion from the crypto market capitalization in the past 24 hours. The total crypto market capitalization dropped 6.15% in the past 24 hours to US$934.43 billion. Total trading volume in the period rose 33.47% to US$59.39 billion. Adding to crypto investors’ concerns, New York State Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit against crypto exchange Kucoin on Thursday, which alleged that Ether and some other crypto assets are securities and should be registered as such. This was the first time that Ether was claimed to be a security by a U.S. attorney general in court. Other U.S. regulators are in public dispute about whether Ether is a commodity or a security, an argument that will affect the status of scores of crypto tokens. Following Silvergate’s failure, cryptocurrency exchange Blockchain.com said on early Friday it was winding down its U.K.-based asset management arm, adding to a raft of retrenchments across the industry since the collapses of the Terra-Luna stablecoin and the FTX exchange last year. U.S. equities slid on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.66% lower, the S&P 500 dropped 1.85%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 2.05%. Fed chair Powell said in testimony on Capitol Hill this week that higher-than-expected interest rates might be needed to curb inflation, depending on the latest economic readings. One data point out on Friday is the February employment report, with analysts forecasting 225,000 new jobs added and a yearly increase in average hourly wages of 4.8%, according to CNBC. If the numbers are as expected, it would support the Fed’s view that inflation remains a problem in the economy. Interest rates in the U.S. are between 4.5% to 4.75%, the highest since October 2007. Analysts at the CME Group predict a 60.9% chance the Fed will raise rates by 50 basis points this month, down from the 78.6% prediction on Thursday. They forecast a 39.1% chance for a 25-basis-point raise, a sharp reversal from the majority view last month. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, expects rates may peak at 6% this year and remain there for an extended time to get inflation back to the central bank’s preferred range of 2%, CNBC reported, citing BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income Rick Rieder. The U.S. annual inflation rate is 6.4% for the 12 months ended January 2023, according to Labor Department data published Feb. 14. The next inflation update is scheduled for March 14 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.

MARKET REACTION: Shares of crypto-related companies fell on Thursday, as the bank's collapse sparked a crisis of confidence in the industry. Silvergate shares were down 26% while peer Signature Bank and former Silvergate partner Coinbase Global Inc fell 8% each. COMMENTS: MARCUS SOTIRIOU, MARKET ANALYST AT GLOBALBLOCK ""Investors are concerned about the consequences of Silvergate's collapse. I think this could have significant implications for crypto regulations in the U.S. and banks' ability to deal with digital asset platforms and cryptocurrency brokerages."" ""Silvergate's demise was not a crypto problem. It was clearly due to Silvergate not having enough cash leading to the lack of capital from the bank run."" KONSTANTIN SHULGA, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER OF FINERY MARKETS ""Traditional banks have refused to engage with crypto companies due to a lack of clear rules, leaving a gap that was filled by a few banks willing to take the risk."" ""One of the largest of these banks was Silvergate, which positioned itself as a crypto-friendly institution. However, this concentration on one player proved to be risky."" ""It's definitely not good for the crypto industry, and this could potentially mean a certain trend towards crypto moving outside the U.S., at least until a more comprehensive regulatory framework is established in the U.S."" MICHAEL PERITO, MANAGING DIRECTOR AT KBW ""It's difficult to know what the ultimate outcome and time-line of this (winding down) process will be."" ""Silvergate still has a $205 million outstanding term loan to Microstrategy as far as we are aware; while this loan was significantly over-collateralized with BTC and performing as of year-end, we don't have insight into how, or at what value this loan could be liquidated at."" AARON KAPLAN, CO-CEO OF PROMETHEUM INC ""In order for events like FTX and Silvergate to be avoided in the future, crypto financial intermediaries need to come into compliance with the federal securities laws. The domino effect from FTX, and the spillover now into the traditional financial system, underscores the need for there to be proper oversight of this industry."" ""This would entail licensing crypto financial intermediaries under the securities laws and oversight by the SEC, and doing this should prevent the kind of debacles that led to the bank run on Silvergate in the first place."" RICHARD MICO, U.S. CEO AND CHIEF LEGAL OFFICER OF BANXA ""There's clearly a regulation-by-enforcement push by federal agencies in the United States – dubbed Operation Chokepoint 2.0 – that is making it harder for crypto-focused financial institutions to operate. Indeed, this pressure is making it increasingly challenging for crypto businesses and traders to operate within the United States.""

In mid-November 2022, Hut 8 stopped mining with 7,000 rigs at a site in North Bay, Ontario, due to an ongoing dispute with its energy provider, Validus Power. Hut 8 has now removed all machines from the facility to a site in Medicine Hat, Alberta. Pressed about progress by analysts on the company's earnings call Thursday morning, Hut 8 CEO Jaime Leverton said the firm is assessing opportunities to energize the miners, but didn't give any concrete alternatives. At its Drumheller site in Alberta, Hut 8 has been facing ""electrical issues"" that have hit operations. ""We are in the early stages exploring supplementary options to mitigate the challenges and hope we have more definitive plan,"" said the firm's newly appointed chief financial officer, Shenif Visram, during the conference call. Hut 8 shares are down 8% on Thursday, as are those of its mining peers, as bitcoin slides to its lowest level in a month at $21,450. Hut 8 did receive a letter of no action from the Canadian competition authority for its proposed merger with U.S. Bitcoin Corp., meaning the authority doesn't plan to challenge the move, Leverton said on the call. The company's main focus is on completing the merger, she said, which will give it access to additional power for mining rigs. Looking at Q4 results, mining profit plunged to CAD$3.33 million (US$2.4 million) from $39.2 million (US$28.4 million) during the same period a year earlier. For all of 2022, the company mined 3,568 bitcoin, up 28.1% from 2021. Hut 8 reported a net loss of CAD$242.8 million for 2022 compared to a loss of CAD$72.7 million for 2021. The company earlier this week disclosed sales of bitcoin for the first time in 2021 as it looked to help fund both operating costs and its merger with U.S. Bitcoin Corp.

Currently, people can claim losses on sales of underwater crypto investments, then repurchase them. The change is part of Biden's 2024 budget proposal could raise $24 billion. President Joe Biden is reportedly targeting a tax loophole used by cryptocurrency investors as part of his 2024 budget proposal that's aimed at cutting country's deficit by trillions of dollars. The Wall Street Journal reported that Biden will propose changing the tax treatment of cryptocurrency transactions. Current rules allow people to sell their underwater crypto investments, claim the loss on their taxes, then immediately buy them back. The administration said such sales are not subject to the so-called wash-sale rule that applies to stocks and bonds, according to the report. The wash-sale rule prevents people from selling stocks and repurchasing them immediately for tax purposes. Biden's 2024 budget proposal was slated for release on Thursday, and the president is targeting a cut of about $3 trillion to the US deficit in the next 10 years. Changing the tax treatment of cryptocurrency transactions could raise $24 billion, according to the Journal. The proposal comes after crypto prices tumbled last year amid the market's persistent ""crypto winter."" Bitcoin fell by more than 60% in 2022, and the broader crypto market's valuation fell below $1 trillion after reaching $3 trillion in 2021.

A White House official confirmed the budget will include a tax provision intended to reduce wash sales trading by crypto investors. At present, investors can sell any cryptocurrencies at a loss, claim the loss on their taxes and then buy the same amount and type of cryptocurrencies again. According to the Wall Street Journal, the provision would be expected to raise up $24 billion. The president's proposed budget will lay out his fiscal priorities. White House officials told the Journal the plan would lower the U.S. deficit by $3 trillion over the next 10 years. Any budget would need passage through the House of Representatives and the Senate before going to the president's desk for his signature. This isn't Washington's first effort to close this ""loophole"" – lawmakers introduced a bill in late 2021 that would similarly prevent investors from claiming a loss only to repurchase the same cryptocurrencies again. The president's team has already passed one crypto tax-related piece of legislation into law; in 2021, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework, which later became the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, included a controversial tax provision that would impose certain reporting rules onto brokers facilitating crypto transactions. The definition of ""broker"" was seen by many in the industry to be overly broad, to the point where miners and other types of entities that don't directly facilitate transactions or collect personal data from those conducting the transactions could be considered brokers. The U.S. Treasury Department has indicated that it would define the term brokers more narrowly, though it has yet to publish formal guidance on the matter."

SVB stock plummeted 68% during Friday's premarket trading session before the halt after dropping more than 60% through Thursday, closing at $106 per share. CNBC's David Faber reported early Friday SVB's planned capital raise announced earlier this week had not cleared the market, and that the firm was now seeking to sell itself. Turmoil for SVB began when the California based bank filed a surprise announcement of a $1.8 billion loss following a deposit outflow and plans to raise $2.25 billion by selling common and preferred stock. Silicon Valley Bank primarily serves startups and technology firms, which have been under pressure as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.  Silicon Valley’s CEO Greg Becker urged calm with venture capitalists Thursday in a call, according to The Information, and asked them not to withdraw money. Bloomberg reported that venture capitalists have urged portfolio companies to trim their exposure to the lender. Another California bank that serves cryptocurrency clients, Silvergate Capital, announced a “voluntary liquidation” Wednesday, the same day Silicon Valley Bank announced its ill-fated capital raise. Shares were also halted in Signature Bank (SBNY), a New York institution that serves some cryptocurrency clients, after its shares dropped more than 16%. First Republic Bank (FRC), which serves some companies in the venture world and also targets high-net worth clients from the tech industry, saw shares fall as much as 40% early Friday. Concerns about risks to other banks spread on Thursday as stocks of giant financial institutions tumbled. A major bank index fell by the most Thursday in nearly three years. Shares for JP Morgan Chase (JPM) fell 5.41% Thursday and shares were roughly flat during Friday's open. Shares of Bank of America (BAC) fell 6.20% Thursday and opened Friday down more than 2%. Citigroup (C) shares fell 4.20% Thursday and opened Friday down more than 1%. Shares of Goldman Sachs Group (GS) fell 7.20% Thursday and an additional 2% Friday. In a Friday morning note, Morgan Stanley analysts said they don’t anticipate this SVB Financial’s challenges will cripple other regional banks. “The funding pressures facing SIVB are highly idiosyncratic and should not be viewed as a read-across to other regional banks,” according to the note. “We do not believe there is a liquidity crunch facing the banking industry, and most banks in our coverage have ample access to liquidity.” David Hollerith is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Futures tied to the S&P 500 (^GSPC) were down 0.2% ahead of the open, while futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined 0.3%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) edged up by 0.1%. January’s job report blew past expectations, as the U.S. economy added more than half a million jobs and the unemployment rate dipped to 3.4%, a level not seen since 1969. But economists aren’t expecting another surprise for Friday’s February jobs print. Consensus estimates from economists are for job gains of 225,000, a slower pace from the January’s blowout number. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.4%. “Signs of slowing outnumber signs of strength, making the chance that last month was a fluke likely,” Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, wrote in a note Friday morning. “At the same time, labor demand continues strong, which suggests a significant drop is also unlikely. A return to the previous trend makes the most sense.” The Federal Reserve has been keeping a close eye on all fronts to the labor market as the central bank tries to cool down inflation. The Friday’s jobs print will show whether January’s hiring gain was an outlier or the start of economic acceleration. Another key point of focus will be wage growth — and whether or not the trend accelerated last month. Meanwhile, other recent data continues to show the economy remains resilient. Consumer spending surged in January, inflation stayed sticky, and business activity expanded in February. The accumulation of economic data, coupled with comments this week from Chair Jerome Powell, has sparked the debate on whether a 0.25% or 0.50% rate hike from the Fed is likely for its March meeting. However, recent events in the banking world have spurred other concerns for Fed officials as their monetary tightening policy induces stresses into the banking system. A major tech firm lender revealed it’s in deep trouble. Silicon Valley Bank’s (SIVB) share price tanked 60% on Thursday, wiping out $9.6 billion of market value after announcing it needs to raise $2.25 billion to offset a $1.8 billion loss on some bond sales. The sour sentiment has spread across markets as the KBW Bank index (^BKX) was down over 7%, while index members including Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) edged lower Friday morning in premarket trading.

""Given the potential impact of weather and seasonality effects in January there is the possibility of another shock last month, albeit mainly to the downside this time,"" wrote Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients earlier this month. Ashworth expects job gains in February will tally 200,000 just below consensus estimates. Friday's report also comes less than two weeks before the Federal Reserve's next policy meeting, with markets now expecting the central bank will raise interest rates by a more aggressive 0.50%.

Follow him on Twitter @MylesUdland and on LinkedIn. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. For the last year, the Federal Reserve has tried to accomplish one goal, using one tool — lower inflation by raising interest rates. The result has been benchmark interest rates rising by 4.5% in a year and headline inflation falling from a peak of 9.1% in June to 6.4% as of January. As Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated in testimony on Capitol Hill this week, there is still work to be done for the Fed to achieve its goal. But over the last week, acute challenges at two banks have surfaced another issue now facing the Powell Fed. And that is the stability of the financial system. On Wednesday, Silvergate Capital (SI), which had become one of the crypto industry's biggest banking partners, announced it will liquidate and wind down operations after suffering significant deposit outflows from its digital asset clients. That same day, Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB), the preferred banking partner of the venture and startup worlds, announced it would take a $1.8 billion loss while liquidating its entire short-term securities book and raising $2.25 billion fresh capital. In a letter to investors, CEO Greg Becker assured investors the bank had ""ample liquidity,"" and said it took these actions ""because we expect continued higher interest rates, pressured public and private markets, and elevated cash burn levels from our clients as they invest in their businesses."" The Information reported Thursday afternoon Becker told investors on a call, ""I would ask everyone to stay calm and to support us just like we supported you during the challenging times."" Few statements have a tougher audience than investors being told to remain calm in times of market stress. On Thursday, U.S. stocks got crushed during a steady, relentless sell-off that centered on the financial sector. Regional banks were hammered. Big banks were hammered. The S&P 500 fell 1.8%. Bitcoin fell 7%. The challenge for Powell, however, is that some of the stress facing Silicon Valley Bank has been induced by the Fed's actions to fight inflation. And the fear is they may not be alone. In the simplest terms, Silicon Valley Bank took a nearly $2 billion hit selling bonds at a loss to buy different bonds that offer a higher yield. The firm's latest annual report showed the bank owned about $14 billion in Treasury securities with an average maturity between 1-5 years. Today, 1-year Treasury bills yield 5.25%. One day's drop in the stock market, of course, is not cause for concern about the financial system. Even the liquidation of one bank and deep investor concerns about another need not constitute a Fed-level worry about the U.S. banking system. But these moves serve as reminders that while the central bank's role in raising or lowering interest rates has become the focal point of investor attention over the last decade, the Fed also serves the central role in stabilizing markets and quelling investor fears during uncertain moments like the present. Almost exactly three years ago, Powell held an emergency Sunday night call on March 15, 2020 to announce a series of measures aimed at supporting the economy as the pandemic rapidly shut down global business. On that call, Powell reminded the assembled press, ""[That] central banks were originally designed to ...provide liquidity to financial systems in stress, so we take that job very seriously. It's probably the most important thing we're doing now is that."" Rising anxiety in the banking system as the ripples from a crypto collapse in 2022 and the icing over of a red hot venture market pale in comparison to the financial emergency the Fed faced three years ago. But their actions then were a reminder of the central bank's power, and, indeed, its centrality to financial markets. When the February jobs report is released Friday morning, investors will pore over the data to decipher whether a 0.25% or 0.50% rate hike from the Fed is likely warranted on March 22. This is the moment markets have been building towards for weeks. But the unforeseen stress now being injected into the banking system makes Friday and the days ahead notable for the Fed in an entirely different manner. That presents to Jay Powell another wrinkle in the challenge of trying to bring order to an economy that busted and boomed in a few short months.

2023-03-10,amzn,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/why-silicon-valley-banks-crisis-is-rattling-americas-biggest-banks-121159393.html,"The problems of two small banks on the West Coast are rippling across markets and causing new investor concerns about some of the country’s largest financial institutions. Why? Three words: rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve’s aggressive campaign to bring down inflation helped set the stage for major problems at two California lending institutions — SVB Financial (SIVB) and Silvergate Capital (SI) — as an outflow of deposits forced both to sell assets at a loss. Those assets were bonds. Banks are big investors in assets like Treasury bills because they need lots of safe places to park their cash. Many financial institutions piled into these investments during a period of historically-low interest rates that spanned the early years of the pandemic, as banks took in tons of new deposits and lending was somewhat restrained. But now the Fed is hiking rates at a rapid clip, with Fed Chair Jay Powell warning earlier this week the central bank may have to speed up the pace of its rate increases to cool the economy further. The problem that creates for banks is simple: higher rates lower the value of their existing bonds. The withdrawals at SVB's Silicon Valley Bank have come from startups and technology firms, many of which also ran into new trouble once the Fed began raising rates. The deposit outflow forced SVB to sell assets and take a $1.8 billion loss, a move the bank it made “because we expect continued higher interest rates, pressured public and private markets, and elevated cash-burn levels from our clients as they invest in their businesses.” Its shares fell more than 60% Thursday. In pre-market trade on Friday SVB shares were down another 60% after overnight reporting from Bloomberg said VC firms ranging from Peter Thiel's Founder Fund to Union Square Ventures had told portfolio companies to pull their money from Silicon Valley Bank. Banks don't have to realize losses on bonds that may have gone down in value amid rising rates if they're not pushed to sell these assets. But Silvergate Capital and SVB Financial didn’t have that choice. Customer withdrawals at Silvergate Bank and SVB’s Silicon Valley Bank forced their hand. At Silvergate, which caters to cryptocurrency clients, customers yanked their money in the panic that followed the 2022 collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Silvergate said in January that it had realized losses of $886 million from selling securities as deposits fell. That weakened the bank considerably. On Wednesday it said it would wind down its bank, and its shares plunged Thursday. After disclosing the $1.8 billion loss and new capital raise, Silicon Valley’s CEO Greg Becker urged calm in a call with venture capitalists Thursday, according to The Information, asking these investors not to withdraw money. It now is seeking to raise $2.25 billion of new capital to cover the new losses. The concern now among investors is that much bigger banks could be forced to do the same. That sent the stocks of giant financial institutions tumbling Thursday, including the biggest of the big: JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC). A major bank index fell by the most Thursday in nearly three years. The biggest U.S. banks are much stronger than they were in the lead up to the last big banking crisis, in 2008, in part because regulators forced them to hold more capital and survive numerous stress test scenarios over the last decade and a half. And the giants have more diverse funding and customer bases than banks such as Silicon Valley or Silvergate, which gives them many more options during challenging times. Longtime banking analyst Mike Mayo said Thursday during an appearance on CNBC the biggest banks are ""a pillar of strength and stability"" and much more resilient than they were prior to the 2008 crisis. ""The biggest risks are outside the largest banks,"" he said, and yet all banks are ""getting painted with the same brush."" Bank stocks, he said, ""have gotten Powelled,"" referring to the Fed chair. ""Going from zero to 5% interest rates in a period that is faster than any time in four decades, you are going to have casualties."" Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chair Martin Gruenberg highlighted the new interest rate risks facing the industry during a speech on March 6, noting that unrealized losses on available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities totaled $620 billion at the end of 2022 across all U.S. banks. ""The current interest rate environment has had dramatic effects on the profitability and risk profile of banks’ funding and investment strategies,"" he said. ""First, as a result of the higher interest rates, longer term maturity assets acquired by banks when interest rates were lower are now worth less than their face values. The result is that most banks have some amount of unrealized losses on securities."" These unrealized losses, he added, ""weaken a bank’s future ability to meet unexpected liquidity needs."" The good news, according to Gruenberg, is that ""banks are generally in a strong financial condition, and have not been forced to realize losses by selling depreciated securities.""

At the closing bell, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down 1.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was off by 1.6%, or 542 points, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down by 2%. Through Thursday's close the market was on pace for its worst week of the year, Bloomberg data showed. The selling on Thursday accelerated throughout the trading session as a collapse in shares of SVB Financial (SIVB) pressured bank stocks and raised concerns over previously unforeseen knock-on effects from the Federal Reserve's rate hiking campaign on the financial system. On Wednesday, SVB announced a $2.25 billion capital raise and the sale of nearly all of its securities portfolio for a loss of $1.8 billion. The company's Silicon Valley Bank subsidiary is the bank for many startups and other players in the venture world. In a letter to investors on Wednesday, the company said: ""We are taking these actions because we expect continued higher interest rates, pressured public and private markets, and elevated cash burn levels from our clients as they invest in their businesses."" The Information reported Thursday afternoon Greg Becker, CEO of Silicon Valley Bank, said on a call with investors, ""I would ask everyone to stay calm and to support us just like we supported you during the challenging times."" Becker also reportedly told investors the bank has ""ample liquidity,"" but said that ""if everyone is telling each other SVB is in trouble, that would be a challenge."" SVB shares fell 60% on Thursday. This decline also weighed on regional banks, with the SPDR Regional Banking ETF (KRE) falling 8% while the SPDR Financial Sector ETF (XLF) fell some 4%. Among major U.S. money-center banks, shares of JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), and Wells Fargo (WFC) were all down more than 5% on Thursday. First Republic Bank (FRC), which maintains a large high net-worth clients business, saw shares fall 16% during Thursday's trading session. As Bloomberg's Jonathan Ferro tweeted, Thursday seems to have marked the moment in the rate-hiking cycle that higher rates are good for banks until they are no longer good. Earlier Thursday, labor market data had been the main catalyst for the market as investors await a crucial jobs report set for release Friday morning. The weekly report on initial filings for unemployment insurance Thursday morning showed 211,000 claims were filed last week, an increase of 21,000 from the prior weak and what economists at Oxford Economics called the ""first hint of weakness"" in this data. ""The jump in jobless claims to 211k last week from 190k is the first sign of weakness in the claims data this year but is still well short of the 300k+ level that would be consistent with a recession,"" Michael Pearce, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients. ""As the Fed presses ahead with more rate hikes, we expect layoffs to eventually rise significantly."" The initial pop from stocks following this data came after two days of testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made clear interest rates are likely to go higher than expected amid strong labor market and inflation data. Stocks finished Wednesday's trading session mixed after a sell-off Tuesday that was triggered by comments from Powell suggesting the Fed will need to raise rates higher than previously forecasted amid stubborn inflation. ""I was surprised by Powell's willingness to accelerate the policy tightening pace, but I am not surprised by the admission that terminal rates will need to rise further,"" said Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro. ""At present, the futures market is priced for a [50 basis point] move in March. There is no point cracking open a door if you don’t intend to walk through."" Data from the CME Group shows markets placing an 80% on the Fed raising rates by 0.50% later this month. Elsewhere in markets, WTI crude oil fell about 1.5% to trade near $75.50 a barrel, a retreat from the $80 a barrel oil was trading near earlier this week. Investors were also keeping a close eye on the Treasury market with the 10-year yield firmer by about 5 basis points, trading at 3.92% after a move higher in yields earlier this week led to a deepening inversion of the yield curve. In single-stock news, shares of Silvergate (SI) were in focus on Thursday after the bank said late Wednesday it would liquidate and wind down its operations after suffering heavy losses amid huge deposit outflows from its digital asset client base. Shares of Silvergate, which have lost more than 95% over the last year, fell 41% on Thursday. Other stocks on the move on Thursday included MongoDB (MDB), which fell 8.3% following a disappointing quarterly report. On the flip side, shares of Asana (ASAN) gained 19% Thursday after a surprisingly strong quarter.

2023-03-09,amzn,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/banks-tumble-svb-ignites-broader-173433069.html,"By Sinéad Carew (Reuters) - The S&P 500 bank index tumbled nearly 6% on Thursday in its biggest one-day drop in over two years as investors fled the industry following SVB Financial Group's share sale announcement and crypto bank Silvergate's decision to wind down operations. Shares of SVB, whose operating segments include Silicon Valley Bank, slumped over 50% in their deepest one-day drop on record after the company announced a $1.75 billion share sale late on Wednesday. SVB is battling cash burn due to declining deposits from startups struggling with a venture capital funding drought. San Francisco headquartered First Republic slumped 15% after hitting its lowest level since October 2020. The SPDR S&P regional banking ETF dropped more than 7% to its lowest level since January 2021. Major U.S. banks were also hit, with JPMorgan and Bank of America both down more than 5%. First Republic and SVB were the S&P 500's deepest percentage decliners in Thursday's trading session, while JPMorgan's loss weighed more than any other stock on the S&P 500's 1.1% decline at mid-day. ""The Silicon Valley raise got everybody nervous about people's capital levels and what deposits are doing. A lot of institutional investors don't feel great about owning certain banks right now,"" said R.J. Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. ""It just gets people freaked out because Silicon Valley, historically has been a very strong, well-run bank. If they're having issues right now, people are wondering what about other banks that are lesser quality and that don't have the reputation that Silicon Valley Bank has."" Investors were also grappling with the decline of cryptocurrency-focused lender Silvergate Capital, which dropped 22% after saying late on Thursday it planned to wind down operations and voluntarily liquidate after it was hit with losses following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. Shares in Silvergate peer Signature bank fell 9.4%.

2023-03-09,amzn,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/mortgage-rates-increase-again-flirt-with-7-170227323.html,"Mortgage rates surged higher this week, closing in on 7%, further cementing affordability concerns in the housing market. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage increased to 6.73% from 6.65% the week prior, according to Freddie Mac. Rates have climbed nearly three-quarters of a point since the beginning of February. The jump in rates continued to fuel the standoff between price-struck homebuyers and hesitant sellers, as elevated home prices weigh on already weak demand ahead of the spring season. Add to that the expectation that rates could soon crest 7% if inflation remains a top concern. “It's not just higher mortgage rates, but really the combination of higher mortgage rates and still higher home prices in most markets that are creating hurdles for buyers,” Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale, told Yahoo Finance. “Even though a greater share of home sellers in today's market have adjusted their price lower, both listing and sale prices have continued to climb on a year-over-year basis.” While the volume of applications to purchase a home increased by 7% for the week ending March 3, overall purchase activity was 42% lower than a year ago, the Mortgage Bankers Association latest survey found. “Even with this jump in activity, both purchase and refinance applications remain well below year-ago levels when rates were much lower,” MBA President and CEO Bob Broeksmit told Yahoo Finance. “The recent increase in mortgage rates, right at the start of the busy spring buying season, could cause prospective buyers to delay decisions until rates moderate.” Buyers still in the market also have to contend with higher list prices from sellers. The national median listing price increased to $415,000 in February, Realtor.com data showed, up from $406,000 the previous month and up 7.8% year over year. That reverses several months of softening listing prices after peaking in June at $449,000, and could suggest that sellers are getting stubborn in offering incentives. Without wiggle room on prices, buyers are seeing their purchasing power evaporate amid rising interest rates. For instance, the monthly mortgage payment for a median-priced home is 49% higher than a year ago at last week’s rate of 6.65%, according to Realtor.com. Buyers are likely to face further affordability challenges entering the spring, Hale noted, because too-low inventory will continue to buoy home prices. “One big reason that home prices continue to climb is that even though we have more homes for sale today, the market is still not back to what was common before the pandemic in most places,” Hale said. “And fewer homes for sale mean there's still some pressure on prices even though buyers are more selective amid higher costs.” As homebuyer demand remains weak, home sellers are feeling more pessimistic and are much less active than last year. There were 15.9% fewer homes listed for sale in February compared with last year, data from Realtor.com showed. Meanwhile, there’s some evidence that sellers are a bit less generous with buyer incentives. For instance, 57% of builders used incentives to close sales in February, the National Association of Home Builders said, down from 62% in December and 59% in November. A growing share of sellers are also pulling back on price reductions, more so than what is typical during this time of the year. According to Realtor.com, 13% of home sellers issued a price cut in February, up from 5.4% a year ago. Still, in January at least 15.3% of sellers lowered their prices to make a sale. Mortgage rates have been marching higher since February after government data revealed the inflation remains a threat. This week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell made it clear to Congress that he isn’t ready to soften his aggressive fight on inflation, indicating that further rate hikes would likely be necessary as we enter the spring. That could likely keep mortgage rates higher. Though “forecasting is far more art than science,” Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com, anticipates that mortgage rates are likely to climb higher before they retreat later this year. “At present, and while there is a chance that rates could retreat to recent bottom levels or perhaps a little below at some point, much depends on what happens with prices, with the Fed, and ultimately whether or not the economy gets to a tipping point and starts to head into recession,” Gumbinger recently told Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-09,amzn,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/9-ways-biden-is-set-to-raise-some-taxes-in-2024-budget-proposal-145357176.html,"President Biden is set to lay out vast and expensive ambitions in his 2024 budget Thursday from shoring up Medicare and boosting domestic spending to reducing the deficit by nearly $3 trillion over the coming decade. To pay for it all, he plans to propose a slate of tax increases, according to multiple peeks at the budget administration officials gave in recent days. There are new taxes on the business world focused on raising the rate on corporate income and on stock buybacks. He will also propose new taxes on wealthy Americans — from changes to how investment income is taxed to a revival of his ""billionaire minimum tax"" on wealth. “I want to make it clear I’m going to raise some taxes,” President Biden said during a recent stop in Virginia, offering one of his many previews of what's to come. Of course, presidential budget proposals are largely symbolic documents that are more about staking out a position rather than being enacted. But they serve as an important marker of Biden’s priorities for the year ahead. “What the president has really here to use is the bully pulpit, meaning once he puts his budget forward, is he going to continue to push some of those ideas?” asked Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget President Maya MacGuineas in a Yahoo Finance Live interview on Wednesday. “If he's serious about it, he'll push it.” Here are some of the new taxes set to be unveiled on Thursday In his budget, President Biden is set to renew his long-standing calls for more taxes on Corporate America. Included in a New York Times preview of the budget document are Biden’s desire to raise the corporate income tax rate to 28% from its current level of 21%. The president is also set to renew his call to quadruple the recently enacted excise tax on stock buybacks, a change he first offered earlier this year during his State of the Union address. On Jan. 1, a new 1% tax on share repurchases went into effect, but has done little to damp business enthusiasm for the practice. The provision is currently set to bring in about $74 billion over the coming decade, and Biden is proposing to increase the rate to 4%. And according to a document reviewed by Reuters, the budget will also propose scrapping tax breaks that oil and gas companies receive. That could likely open up another front in the back and forth between the White House and oil companies over record profits they've enjoyed since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The new proposals come after last year’s Inflation Reduction Act imposed multiple new taxes on businesses, including the 1% stock buyback excise tax and a new corporate book minimum tax. Going after more taxes so shortly after last year's victory likely will inflame critics. Erica York, a senior economist at the Tax Foundation, argued in an interview Wednesday with Yahoo Finance that Biden’s policies were already “heading in the wrong direction and the president's budget is going to double down on that.” “I would say wait and see how it plays out before you double down or quadruple down on it,” she added. Biden is also set to propose new taxes on Americans making over $400,000 a year. The president rolled out his most controversial proposal during this year’s State of the Union with a potential new tax that would target wealth, not just income. “We have to reward work, not just wealth,” President Biden said in his speech. “No billionaire should be paying a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter.” According to a preview offered to Bloomberg, the president will lay out new details on that, including a call for a 25% minimum tax on households worth more than $100 million as well as an increase in the capital gains rate for wealthy Americans. Other tax ideas that were present in previous budgets are set to be revived for 2024, including ending the so-called carried-interest loophole and eliminating some tax breaks around real-estate profits. All told, the various increases would fund nearly $3 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade and also fund other Biden priorities. The deficit reduction will come in a budget that “achieves this while lowering costs for families, investing in America, and protecting programs Americans have paid into because it proposes tax reforms to ensure the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share, while cutting wasteful spending on special interests — interests like Big Oil and Big Pharma,” Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Wednesday. Finally, the White House previewed new taxes to shore up the Medicare program earlier this week. Biden will propose increases on payroll taxes on Americans making over $400,000 per year; closing loopholes that shields some “pass-through” income from Medicare taxes; and allowing Medicare to negotiate on a wider array of prescription drugs. Those provisions, which Biden reviewed in a New York Times op-ed on Tuesday, would extend the program through 2050. Critics have noted that many of these proposals would be untested ways to fund the health care program for retirees. York also noted that some of the rule changes around the net investment income tax would help Medicare's finances by diverting some money from the government’s general fund. “Of course that looks like you're strengthening Medicare, but you're creating a hole in the budget elsewhere,” she said, noting the plan also increases the net investment income tax from 3.8% to 5% and would therefore also bring in more money overall. Republicans have been promising for weeks that Biden’s proposals won’t see the light of day. This is hardly new — there's an old saying in Washington about budgets that “the president proposes and Congress disposes” — but it will nevertheless increase pressure on House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) to offer his own proposal in the coming months. MacGuineas, who previewed the dueling proposals, noted that the White House budget will likely focus on tax increases and the GOP plan will revolve around spending cuts. “Neither of them is realistic, and, frankly, neither of them is the right policy,” she said. “We need compromises on both.” Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.

Subscribe Thursday, March 9, 2023 Today's newsletter is by Jared Blikre, a reporter focused on the markets on Yahoo Finance. Follow him on Twitter @SPYJared. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. Fed chair Jay Powell just poured cold water on the ""no landing"" crowd hoping to avert a U.S. recession and rally stocks to fresh record highs this year. After two days of grilling before Congress, investors have been reminded (again) that the Fed chief still sees inflation as a persistent, pernicious threat. Stocks and bonds took notice Wednesday, as both sold off amid surging short-term rates — leaving the major indices underwater for the week as of the close. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes,"" said Powell before the Senate. And with two weeks to go until the next Fed meeting, markets are now expecting exactly that. Bonds and derivatives are pricing in a more hawkish outcome — expecting the Fed to lift its benchmark rate 50 basis points instead of 25 basis points. Since Monday's settlement, the U.S. 2-year Treasury-Note yield has surged 18 basis points to 5.06% — the highest level since 2007. It also deepened its inversion over the 10-year yield, with the spread reaching negative 108 basis points (or -1.08 percentage points) — the highest since the early 1980s when Paul Volcker was the Fed chair fighting a similar battle over price inflation. Under normal conditions, interest rates of longer-term loans or bonds (the cost of money) are expected to be more expensive than their shorter-term counterparts, as risk is higher on the long end. But this changes when the Fed starts stamping out animal spirits, lifting short-term rates to restrict the creation of credit and eventually choke off growth. While the magnitude, or depth, of a yield curve inversion isn't necessarily predictive of a deeper, or longer recession, there are a host of other indicators in the bond market that are sounding alarm bells. Former bond trader and CEO of TheMacroCompass.com Alfonso Peccatiello recently joined Yahoo Finance Live to offer his insights. Peccatiello notes that the bond market expects the Fed to fight inflation and remain tight, with interest rates well over 5% a year from now. ""That cannot happen if a recession is unfolding. The Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates,"" he said. Essentially, the inflation-fighting credibility that Powell has earned in the markets comes with a cost — pushing expectations of Fed capitulation far beyond what occurs historically. ""The issue is — the tighter you keep borrowing conditions for the private sector, the higher you keep mortgage rates, the higher you keep corporate borrowing rates — the higher the chances you're going to freeze these credit markets and basically sleepwalk into an accident or, in general, accelerate a recession later on,"" said Peccatiello. But long before the Fed delivers relief in the form of cuts, Peccatiello expects stocks to suffer from an earnings recession, which, he says, ""isn't fully priced in."" (An earnings recession — marked by two consecutive quarterly declines in S&P 500 earnings — often, but not always precedes an economic recession.) Peccatiello believes the U.S. is already in an earnings recession, with stocks reflecting complacency. Nevertheless, he doesn't expect a disaster. He sees about 10% maximum downside risk in the S&P 500 down to the 3600 level, which is right around last year's lows. ""I don't think it's going to be much lower than that,"" he says, adding, ""[T]he stock market generally bottoms before earnings bottom."" The reason gets back to the Fed, which historically capitulates and slashes rates as earnings drop. The Fed rate cuts then get incorporated into better stock valuations, which eventually halt the decline in stock prices, Peccatiello added. ""[This] means the stock market can stop its decline and start slowly but surely moving into a new bull market.""

""We have not made any decision,"" he told the House Financial Services Committee, saying key reports on employment and inflation would govern any moves. The remarks came a day after he told the Senate Banking Committee that, ""we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes"" if the data supported it. That spurred traders to price in a higher chance of a 0.50% hike than a 0.25% increase later this month. “We're going to be looking at the totality of data,"" Powell said Wednesday during questioning from House members. ""We are not on a preset path,"" he added. Powell said the Fed wants to see the upcoming employment report Friday, along with key inflation reports on the consumer and producer price indexes, before making a judgment. On Wednesday, the Dow dropped 0.18%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.14%, and the Nasdaq rose 0.40%. When asked by Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D, Mass.) whether the Fed would pause interest rates to avoid a recession, the chairman called it a serious question and noted that he wouldn’t say yes or no. The Fed, he said, is not ""seeking a recession."" Powell also said the era of low interest rates is likely over. ""Now, we have the 10-year [Treasury yield] back close to 4%,"" said Powell. ""And I think, we need to be careful not to assume that these secular low, longer term rates, will continue indefinitely because it doesn't look likely now."" Democrats, including Democratic Ranking Member Maxine Waters (D, CA) asked him to comment on the prospect of a U.S. default if Congress is not able to raise the debt ceiling. Powell warned that the Fed can’t protect the economy from brinksmanship or a default. ""No one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the non-payment of the government's bills, let alone a debt default, which I don't think will happen, but no one should think we have the tools to protect against the effects of that,"" said Powell. When asked whether the Fed would accept a trillion-dollar coin to avoid a debt default, Powell said there are no rabbits to be pulled out of hats and that would be a ""rabbit coming out of a hat."" House Republicans expressed concerns about reviewing and potentially increasing capital requirements for banks. Patrick McHenry, the chairman of the House committee, questioned the motivation of a ""holistic review"" of these requirements from the Fed’s Vice Chair of Supervision Michael Barr, saying the Fed shouldn’t operate in the shadows when the regulation in question can have broad and significant economic effects. McHenry also accused the Fed of laying the groundwork for a new climate policy. ""The Fed needs to stick to its knitting,"" said McHenry. ""I agree there is concern for many that the Fed is picking up new needles and knitting partisan sweaters at such a precarious time for our economy here at home in the global economy. That would be a mistake."" Powell’s comments Wednesday were his last before the Fed’s policy meeting in two weeks.

2023-03-08,amzn,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-march-8-2023-124051164.html,"U.S. stocks finished mixed on Wednesday, following two job prints that showed the labor market remains tight amid sticky inflation. Wall Street also heard from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday morning. Powell continued to stress that ""no decision"" has been made on the size of the Fed's upcoming interest-rate increase at its March policy meeting. ""When say we will look at the totality of data, that will include these next reports. We will carefully analyze. Haven't made a decision on the March meeting. Larger point is that we are not on a preset path,"" said Powell during his second day of testimony before Congress. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended the day up 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined by 0.2%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added 0.4%. Bond yields inched higher alongside a stronger dollar. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked up to 3.98% Wednesday. U.S. stocks plummeted Tuesday after Powell said during his Senate Banking Committee testimony that interest rates may rise “higher” than previously expected as the Fed continues a persistent fight against inflation. Powell’s comments on Capitol Hill triggered a 1.5% selloff in equities, according to JP Morgan’s trading desk. Tuesday’s losses saw every sector lower, with financials and real estate logging the biggest declines for the day. Treasury yields were higher, with the 2-year yield tipping above 5%, while the spread between the 10-year and 2-year US Treasury yields inverted for the first time since September 1981. According to strategists at Deutsche Bank, reaching this level signals a recession could be underway or has occurred within a maximum of eight months. “Powell’s speech indicates that the Fed will heavily depend on near-term data for upcoming rates decisions,” Michael Feroli, Chief U.S. Economist at JP Morgan, wrote in a note Wednesday morning. ""With January’s macro data mostly printing on the hawkish side, NFP Friday and CPI next Tuesday are the most critical catalysts for Fed’s decision between 25bp and 50bp,” Feroli added. Still, on the economic data side, ADP’s monthly read on private payroll growth rose by 242,000 in February, above consensus expectations for 200,000. ADP also tracked pay growth for those workers who stayed in their position, which decelerated to 7.2% last month, the slowest pace of gains within in the last year. “There is a tradeoff in the labor market right now,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist, ADP, wrote in the press release. ""We're seeing robust hiring, which is good for the economy and workers, but pay growth is still quite elevated. The modest slowdown in pay increases, on its own, is unlikely to drive down inflation rapidly in the near term.” Meanwhile, the U.S. monthly international trade deficit increased to $68.3 billion in January, below the consensus deficit of $68.7 billion as imports increased more than exports, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the U.S. Census Bureau. Another highlight Wednesday morning was January’s report on the number of job openings, which fell to 10.82 million, down from the upwardly revised 11.2 million openings in the prior month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. The construction, leisure, hospitality, and finance industries showed significant pullbacks in job openings. ""While the January JOLTS report shows job openings are heading in the right direction for the Fed, the decline is far too modest to convince that labor market conditions are cooling enough to bring down inflation,"" Matthew Martin, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a statement following the release. February’s jobs report out on Friday will hold more clues about the strength of the economy. Economists expect 215,000 new jobs will be added to the economy, a slower pace than January’s blowout number of 517,000 job additions. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.4%. Another key point from the reading will be wage growth, with a 0.3% month-to-month bump in average hourly earnings anticipated and 4.7% over the last year. In single-stock moves, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) gained over 2% Wednesday after a regulatory filing revealed that Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway bought nearly 6 million shares of the oil company in recent days, raising its stake in the company to 200.2 million shares worth $12.2 billion. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD) shares rose 3% Wednesday after the security software provider reported fourth-quarter earnings that topped analysts' expectations and issued stronger guidance for the fiscal first quarter. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) dipped 3% as Berenberg analyst Adrian Yanoshik slashed his rating on the stock from buy to hold, citing ""based on misplaced fears of a price war – appears to have been accepted by the market,"" Yanoshik noted. Separately, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened an investigation into the Model Y SUV over a concern with its steering wheels. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-08,amzn,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/key-recession-indicator-yield-inversion-treasury-160255114.html,"The Treasury market is sending its sharpest warning about recession risks since 1981. On Tuesday, the difference in the yield on 2-year and 10-year Treasury notes further inverted, with the yield on the 10-year falling 103 basis points, or 1.03 percentage points, below the yield on the 2-year yield. This dynamic has preceded each of the last eight U.S. recessions. By this measure, the yield curve has been inverted since July of last year as investors bet aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve to combat inflation would tip the economy into recession. In an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled the central bank will likely be more aggressive than it previously forecast in raising interest rates this year as inflation proves stubborn and the labor market remains strong. ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,"" Powell told the Senate Banking Committee in prepared remarks. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes."" ""Although inflation has been moderating in recent months, the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy,"" Powell added. The Fed will announce its next policy decision on March 22, a statement that will also be accompanied by new projections on where Fed officials see interest rates headed over the rest of this year and the next two. Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients Tuesday that Powell ""opened the door for the central bank to accelerate the pace of rate hikes and raise the target range of the fed funds rate more than anticipated because of the recent hot data on job growth and inflation."" Sweet noted investors are now pricing in 100 basis points of additional rate hikes from the Fed this year, up from the 75 basis points previously expected by most economists. Data from the CME Group showed Wednesday morning markets are now pricing in a nearly 80% chance the Fed raises rates by 50 basis points, or 0.50%, at its meeting later this month. As Yahoo Finance's Brian Cheung noted last year, there is nothing about Treasury yields themselves, or the relationship between the yield at any two points along the curve, that signals recession. Rather, it is what yields imply about future interest rates — and in turn future economic growth — that offers worrying signs for investors. While it is hotly debated what, exactly, ""goes into"" the yield for any Treasury security, a simple axiom used by many investors says Treasury yields indicate what the expected average of the fed funds rate, or the Fed's benchmark interest rate, will be over a given time period. With the 2-year yield standing at around 5% as of Wednesday morning, this implies investors think the fed funds rate will be, on average, 5% over the next two years. Today, the fed funds rate stands at roughly 4.6%, as the Fed's target interest rate range is 4.5%-4.75% following its decision last month to raise rates an additional 25 basis points. Therefore, we can say investors are anticipating the Fed will raise rates to at least 5% and keep them there for two years, or raise rates above 5% for some period of time before cutting them such that the average Fed funds rate is 5%. Duke professor Campbell Harvey, who uncovered this ""recession indicator"" in the 1980s, told Bloomberg in an interview earlier this year he thinks the economy can avoid recession despite warnings coming from his work. In part, in Harvey's view, this is because market awareness of this indicator has lessened its potency as a predictive measure. Notably, Harvey's worked actually focused on the spread between the 3-month Treasury bill and the 10-year Treasury note as the most potent recession indicator, not the now-popular 2-year/10-year spread. The spread between these two tenors along the curve currently stands at minus 107 basis points, still a clear recession signal by Harvey's work.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. The retail business is simple — buy from wholesalers, sell to consumers, pocket the difference. In exchange for capturing this difference between the wholesale and retail cost of goods, retailers take on the financial risk of fronting money to one party while working to make it back and then some from another. At the scale of the U.S. consumer economy, the differences between an additional week in a quarter, an additional weekend in a month, or even an additional day in a year can be millions of dollars or more. And if the timing of a day or two can disrupt the financial fortunes of a business — meaning there can be just hours between profits and losses — then one can imagine the challenges faced by retailers during the supply chain disruptions that results from the pandemic. In 2021, the story was that retailers were unable to match consumer demand as the economy re-opened. In 2022, supply chains that got unstuck eventually left retailers with more stock than they needed. As 2023 gets underway, retailers are suggesting the balance may finally be just right. Sporting goods retailer Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) reported fourth quarter results Tuesday morning that impressed investors, with shares rising 11% after the company offered a full-year earnings forecast well above expectations. And driving this profit forecast were inventories that are in ""great shape"" ahead of the company's busy spring season. ""As planned, we continued to address targeted inventory overages, and as a result our inventory is in great shape as we start 2023. We couldn't be more excited about our spring assortment,"" said Lauren Hobart, president and CEO. Dick's CFO Navdeep Gupta added on a call with analysts Tuesday morning, ""We were chasing inventory last year amidst industry-wide supply chain disruptions. ...Compared to Q4 of 2019, a 38% increase in sales was well ahead of our 29% increase in inventory. Our inventory is healthy and well positioned."" Looking at economy-wide data, we can see inventory-to-sales levels are still depressed relative to pre-pandemic levels. Though this measure is in part driven by strong sales, which keeps the ratio of inventories to sales low. Still, comments from Dick's were the latest echo of a refrain heard often from the industry as retail results have poured in over the last few weeks. And that refrain says the industry is finally finding something like a ""normal"" setting after three pandemic-altered years. Back in late February, Walmart (WMT) CEO Doug McMillon said his team, ""acted quickly and aggressively to address the inventory and cost challenges we faced last year."" ""We ended the quarter with inventory about flat to last year which is better than we anticipated and even better when you consider how inflation lifts that number,"" McMillon added on a call with analysts. ""And [we] did it while improving in-stock levels."" McMillon added: ""And so as we look at where we are today with much better position around inventory...I feel like this year will be more of a normal environment for markdowns or certainly more normal than what it was last year."" The company did, however, say there was ""work to be done"" on its apparel inventory levels. But clothing retailers Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN) both indicated in their latest reports inventory levels continue to improve. ""Despite an increasingly volatile macroeconomic climate, through the ongoing execution of our Polaris strategy, we remained agile, pivoted to meet customer demand and elevated our approach to inventory management,” said Jeff Gennette, Macy's chairman and CEO. ""In the fourth quarter, we benefited from our disciplined inventory approach."" The company reported inventory levels that were down 3% from last year and said, ""Inventory productivity continues to be a focus for the company in 2023 and beyond."" Nordstrom, for its part, said inventory levels were down 15% from last year and at levels similar to those that prevailed in 2019, the last year before the pandemic. ""We took decisive actions to right-size our inventory as we entered the new year, positioning us for greater agility amidst continuing macroeconomic uncertainty,"" said CEO Erik Nordstrom.

2023-03-07,amzn,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-today-live-updates-march-7-2023-143312540.html,"U.S. stocks fell Tuesday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress that interest rates are likely to go ""higher"" in the face of persistent inflation. At the closing bell on Tuesday, the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 1.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) sunk 1.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) plummeted 1.2%. Tuesday's losses saw the S&P 500 fall by the most in two weeks and trade back below the key 4,000 level. The index also broke its 50-day moving average, an indicator traders closely watch for signs stocks are breaking from recent trends. ""Fed Chair Jerome Powell confirmed today that interest rates are set to rise higher than we previously anticipated,"" wrote Andrew Hunter, deputy chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. ""But with most evidence still pointing to economic weakness and markedly lower inflation this year, we still believe the Fed will begin cutting rates again sooner than markets are expecting."" Powell delivered the first of his two days of semi-annual testimony to Congress on Tuesday, speaking before the Senate Banking Committee ahead of Wednesday's appearance before the House Financial Services Committee. In his prepared testimony released Tuesday, Powell spoke of a sustained central bank campaign to rein in inflation. ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,"" Powell said. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes."" Answering questions from lawmakers, Powell said the full impacts of the Fed's interest rate increases haven't yet been felt in the economy. Markets have begun to price in at least two additional 0.25% rate hikes from the central bank over its next two meetings; investors began the year with optimism the Fed would stop its rate-hiking campaign as soon as February. Powell's comments Tuesday opened the door to the possibility of both a higher terminal federal funds rate, as well as a higher pace of increases. According to data from CME Group, Powell's comments spurred traders to price in a higher chance of a 0.50% hike than a 0.25% increase later this month. The Fed will kick off its next two-day policy meeting in two weeks, with a policy announcement set for the afternoon of March 22. Elsewhere in markets, WTI crude oil was under pressure, falling more than 3.7% to around $77.40 per barrel. The 10-year Treasury yield, which has been a focal point of market action over the last few weeks, was little-changed, settling near 3.98%. On the earnings side, results from Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) early this morning sent shares of the sporting goods retailer higher by 11%. The company offered full-year earnings per share guidance that came in more than $1 per share above expectations, according to Bloomberg data. Dick's expects to earn $12.90-$13.80 per share in its fiscal 2023, up from the $12.04 the company earned last year. Same-store sales in the company's fourth quarter rose 5.3% with CEO Ed Stack telling investors the company's inventory levels are in ""great shape"" to start 2023. Elsewhere in single-stock moves, shares of Snap (SNAP) gained more than 9% on Monday — and had been up as much as 4% on Tuesday before paring gains to close up just 0.5% — with Bloomberg attributing the rally to optimism over a TikTok ban in the U.S. Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"
2023-03-07,amzn,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/powell-tells-congress-rates-will-likely-be-higher-than-previously-anticipated-150011657.html,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Tuesday interest rates are likely to rise more than previously expected as the central bank works to bring down inflation, which remains stubbornly above the central bank's 2% target. U.S. stocks were trading lower Tuesday as some analysts said the comments were more hawkish than expected. Near 2:20 p.m. ET, the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) was near session lows, falling 1.5%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) off 1.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) falling 1.2%. ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,"" Powell told the Senate Banking Committee in prepared remarks. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes."" ""Although inflation has been moderating in recent months, the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy,"" Powell added. The latest Consumer Price Index report released last month showed prices rose 6.4% over the prior year in January, a slowdown from last summer's peak inflation rate of 9.1% but still well above the Fed's 2% target. Powell's comments spurred traders to price in a higher chance of a 0.50% hike than a 0.25% increase later this month, according to data from CME Group. In a note, Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner said Powell’s remarks ""opened the door"" to a return of 0.50% hikes, ""If the incoming data flow warrants it."" If there are ""upside surprises"" in a jobs report this Friday from the Labor Department, that could ""drive a faster and longer tightening cycle,"" according to Zentner's note. The Fed projected at its December policy meeting interest rates would need to rise to a range of 5%-5.25% this year, though Powell's comments now suggest rates will need to eventually rise above this level. Following the Fed's February policy decision, the central bank's benchmark interest rate stands in a range of 4.5%-4.75%. Some Senate Democrats challenged Powell during Tuesday’s hearing, cautioning that his rate hikes could lead to job losses. Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown (D-OH) said there are other ways to bring down prices, citing the strengthening of supply chains, boosting of U.S. manufacturing and the rebuilding of infrastructure. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said if the central bank raises rates as much as planned, to 5%-5.25% excluding any further rate hikes Powell has now suggested above that level, unemployment would rise to 4.6%. That, she said, would cost two million people jobs. ""Chair Powell, if you could speak directly to the two million hardworking people who have decent jobs today, who you're planning to get fired over the next year, what would you say to them?"" Warren asked. Powell, in response, said: ""I would explain to people more broadly that inflation is extremely high and it's hurting the working people of this country badly. All of them, not just two million of them, but all of them are suffering under high inflation, and we are taking the only measures we have to bring inflation down."" In a hat tip to these concerns, Powell said in his prepared remarks that the Fed is ""acutely aware"" high inflation is causing ""significant hardship"" for Americans while also pledging to “stay the course until the job is done."" The Fed chair said Tuesday policymakers will continue to make decisions on a meeting by meeting basis. Powell noted that economic data from January on inflation, job growth, consumer spending, and manufacturing production have partly reversed course from the slowdown seen back in December. Powell attributed some of the softening to unseasonably warm weather in January, but cautioned that the ""breadth of the reversal"" suggests inflation is running higher than expected. He reiterated the Fed still needs to see a drop in services inflation excluding housing to bring inflation down, which is likely to require a weaker job market.

2023-03-07,amzn,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/heres-what-biden-wants-to-do-to-shore-up-medicare-135302609.html,"President Biden is set to formally release his 2024 budget proposal later this week and is already offering previews on what he plans to do with Medicare. In new details released Tuesday to keep the program afloat into the 2050s, Biden says he can extend the solvency of the program without any benefit cuts via three moves: an increase on the tax rate on both earned and unearned income above $400,000; the closing of loopholes that shields some “pass-through” income from Medicare taxes; and allowing Medicare to negotiate on a wider array of prescription drugs. And overall, the president is looking at least five different tax changes for wealthy Americans and corporations to pay for his myriad ideas — both for Medicare and his larger push to “invest in America” and pay down the deficit. And while the proposal isn’t likely to get a vote on Capitol Hill, it will serve as an important marker of Biden’s priorities. The early focus on Medicare — as well as Social Security — underlines just how “deeply embedded” the twin programs have become in Biden’s political identity, Alex Lawson, the executive director of a group called Social Security Works, recently noted in an interview. The president talks nearly every week about the program and also released a New York Times op-ed on the topic Tuesday morning. Defending the programs now “seems to be one of the defining characteristics of Biden-world,” Lawson added. What the White House appears to be doing with this week’s choreographed multi-day rollout — culminating in a formal unveiling on Thursday in Philadelphia — is an attempt to shape the conversation as both the debt ceiling fight heats up this summer and a likely Biden 2024 re-election campaign kicks off. In the op-ed released Tuesday morning, President Biden wrote that “Medicare is more than a government program. It’s the rock-solid guarantee that Americans have counted on to be there for them when they retire."" The issue is top of mind with a key Medicare trust fund likely to run low on funds as early as 2028, according to a recent government trustees report. Meanwhile, Social Security likely has the funds to continue paying out current benefits for only a few years longer, through 2034. Biden’s proposal would increase the Medicare tax rate from 3.8% to 5% on all income above $400,000. It would also target what is known as net investment income - an additional fee on the returns for high-income earners as well as “pass through” business for Americans above $400,000 per year. The White House aims to change the rules and close loopholes around that income, which it notes can be shielded from the taxes that fund the Medicare program because it is classified currently as “neither earned income nor investment income.” The proposal would close loopholes in that area and also change the government's rules to allow that money to be sent to Medicare’s crucial Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, President of the American Action Forum, noted in a Yahoo Finance Live interview on Tuesday that the net investment tax piece is ""really using a tool that has never been used in Medicare before [and] it's not a particularly good piece of tax policy."" Holtz-Eakin, a Republican and former director of the Congressional Budget Office, added that the way to get these programs under control fiscally is to control growth, and ""you can't tax your way out of this."" The budget will also propose savings via new prescription drug reforms by giving Medicare the authority to negotiate prices for additional higher-cost drugs. The White House estimates these changes will save $200 billion over the coming decade. “There are ways in which the program can be operated more efficiently,” said Paul Van de Water, a Medicare specialist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who also listed other options for the years ahead like lowering payment rates to healthcare providers and limiting payments to Medicare Advantage. But even with all that, “it's still going to be essential we think to raise additional revenues,” he said. Van de Water also noted that Biden has previously proposed changes to the net investment income tax during a previous budget proposal. Thursday’s release will be Biden’s third since taking office. Tuesday’s unveiling is just the first step in what is much more detail to come about Biden's ideas and how he’ll pay for it all. In a recent online video, Biden’s budget director, Shalanda Young, outlined the overall priorities, including expanding the economy, lowering costs, protecting Social Security and Medicare as well as reducing the deficit by $2 trillion over the coming decade. So what other tax increases could be proposed? Administration officials say that both wealthy Americans and corporations will be the focus. In his State of the Union, Biden called to quadruple the excise tax on stock buybacks and to institute a new ""billionaire minimum tax"" on wealth. Both appear set for repeat appearances on Thursday. The president could also call to raise the top corporate tax rate, which would come in addition to a corporate minimum tax instituted last year as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. While House Republicans have pledged that all tax increases are off the table and won't be considered in the House. But the move will increase the pressure on Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) to release his own plan, something he has promised is coming soon. What Speaker McCarthy has discussed in the past is creating the “path” to balance the budget. House Republicans have already floated some small-scale proposals — targeting things like Medicaid and what they term as “woke waste.” What’s unclear — and Democrats and some budget experts charge is impossible — is how that plan takes a significant bite out of the deficit if Social Security, Medicare, and tax increases are all off the table. “We’re not going to sit here and be lectured by those folks about fiscal responsibility,” Biden said recently in a preview of the likely debate to come, adding of the GOP, it will “be interesting to see what they want to cut and what their numbers add up to.” This post has been updated.

Subscribe Tuesday, March 7, 2023 Today's newsletter is by Julie Hyman, anchor and correspondent at Yahoo Finance. Follow Julie on Twitter @juleshyman. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. When Fed Chair Jay Powell settles in for his semi-annual testimony to the Senate Banking Committee today, investors will be looking for confirmation that the central bank is going to keep raising interest rates for the next several meetings to fight inflation. Besides the ongoing debate about whether the Fed’s actions are going to send the U.S. economy into recession and stocks into a tailspin, there’s been one other important side effect: the bond market is the hottest it’s been in years. That’s newly true not just for institutional investors, but for retail traders as well. That’s because online trading of Treasuries is accessible at a critical mass for the first time with rates at these levels. It's never been easier to buy, be it directly via the Treasury Department, from the discount brokerages, or through ETFs. The repricing of rate expectations this year has sent yields on many Treasury notes and bonds to their highest in 15 years, with the 2-year, 10-year (TNX), and 30-year all yielding around 4%. It’s been a huge shift for fixed income. Besides institutional investors salivating over government and corporate debt, retail traders are so keen they've repeatedly crashed the TreasuryDirect website, which provides a conduit to Treasuries and I bonds. (The latter is an inflation-protected instrument that has both a fixed rate and one that changes with inflation). “For pretty much the entire decade, leading up to this year, when people asked about retail and fixed income, I could just simply say, ‘no one really cares.’ The past year, that has significantly changed,” Shawn Cruz, Head Trading Strategist at TD Ameritrade, told Yahoo Finance. Sales of Treasury bills – those with maturities of one year or less – through TreasuryDirect were $12.0 billion in January, a record. Before last August, that number hadn’t cracked $5 billion. Net sales of I bonds were $4.2 billion in January, after spiking to $6.8 billion last October. Salim Ramji, Global Head of iShares and Index Investments at BlackRock, was enthusiastic about fixed income when he recently spoke to Yahoo Finance: “It’s a great time for investors to look for yield, but they don’t have to take the kind of risk that they might have two, three, four years ago, because you can get 4% yields in Treasuries. You can get 5% yields in investment grade, even at the front end.” BlackRock, as the largest provider of ETFs by assets, has benefited from the boom. Thus far in 2023, investors have poured $9.9 billion into U.S. iShares fixed income ETFs. And not all investors are going long; the firm’s most popular instrument in February in the category was the iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF (SHV). How long will the party last? Even if the Fed raises interest rates at its next three meetings, some strategists have called for a longer period of higher inflation and higher interest rates, an end to the so-called “Great Moderation.”  BlackRock predicts that fixed income ETF assets under management will reach $5 trillion by 2030. As Ramji said, “Having rates as low as they were for as long as they were was kind of the aberration. I think we’re resetting back now to a much more normal fixed income environment, and the great thing for investors, as a result, is they can use it to generate income, and so for retirees or people looking at their wealth portfolios, they’re able to generate good, long-term income from long-term investments like Treasuries or investment grade.” In other words, for a lot of retail investors right now, boring is beautiful. - Economy Wholesale Inventories, January Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before Senate Banking Committee Earnings Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS); Casey's General (CASY); CrowdStrike (CRWD); Manchester United (MANU); Sea Limited (SE); Stitch Fix (SFIX); Thor Industries (THO) Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"
2023-03-06,amzn,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-march-6-2023-123642397.html,"U.S. stocks lost steam Monday afternoon after rallying earlier in the session, kicking off a busy week on Wall Street with a mixed tone. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended the session near the flatline, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) increased 0.1%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) edged down 0.1%, reversing its gains from earlier in the trading session. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note hovered near 4% Monday afternoon, before settling at 3.98%. Crude oil traded higher, with U.S. benchmark WTI up at $80.55 a barrel. The dollar index moved lower trading at $104.34. U.S. stocks gained on Friday to close out a volatile week, while bond yields pulled back from their recent highs. The three major indexes rose for the week, with the Dow Jones adding 1.7%, the S&P 500 closing 1.9% higher, and the Nasdaq gaining 2.6%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury settled back below the key 4% level, and the two-year yield fell to 4.86%. Economic data released on Friday showed the services sector grew in February. This week, Wall Street will be paying close attention to the monthly jobs report out Friday. The February jobs report is expected to show 215,000 new jobs have been added to the economy, according to economist estimates, a slower pace from January’s blowout number of 517,000 job additions. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.4%. Another key point from the report will be wage growth, with a 0.3% month-to-month bump in average hourly earnings anticipated and 4.7% over the last year. Economists at Bank of America, led by Michael Gapen, believe a deceleration from January will be tied largely to weather shifts and a general mean-reverting nature of payrolls. ""Typically, when payroll growth records a sizable increase or decrease, we see a reversal in the following month,"" the firm noted. Also, investors will be keeping an eye on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's two-day biannual monetary policy testimony on Capitol Hill, which begins Tuesday. Other highlights this week include ADP’s monthly read on private payroll growth, January’s report on job openings from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Fed’s Beige Book. In single stock moves, Apple (AAPL) shares gained nearly 2% on Monday as Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng initiated coverage of Apple with a buy rating and a price target of $199. Ng noted Apple's success in hardware design and brand loyalty has led to a growing installed base of users that provide visibility into revenue growth. And Apple's valuation is attractive relative to its historical multiple and to peers. Ciena (CIEN) shares jumped 4% Monday after the company posted better than expected results that topped analysts expectations amid strong demand in its networking platforms business. Shares of BridgeBio Pharma (BBIO) surged more than 50% after the company topped Wall Street's expectations in a study of children with achondroplasia, a genetic condition that slows bone growth. Snap (SNAP) shares climbed 9% amid growing chatter that the U.S. could restrict — or ban — use of the TikTok app. Spirit Airlines (SAVE) shares tanked nearly 9% following reports that JetBlue Airways (JBLU) is bracing for turbulence from the Justice Department as it tries to block the airline's planned takeover of Spirit Airlines in the coming days, The Wall Street Journal reported. JetBlue shares finished up about 1%. On the earnings front, Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Oracle (ORCL) and BJ's Wholesale (BJ) are set to report results this week. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-06,amzn,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/as-airbnb-wins-back-wall-street-some-hosts-see-saturation-130755035.html,"Airbnb (ABNB) dazzled Wall Street with better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings results and forward guidance on February 14. ""We believe ADR [average daily rate] was the key upside surprise relative to investor expectations,"" Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni wrote about the company's Q1 guidance in a research note, ""which should help support more optimism around further upside on pricing and margin in the remaining three quarters [of 2023]."" Investors cheered the company's quarter by sending shares up 13% on February 15, the stock's biggest one-day increase since Airbnb's December 2020 IPO. On February 16, the stock logged its highest close since May 2022. Even after giving back some post-earnings gains, Airbnb stock is up about 45% from a record low reached at the end of 2022. But the sentiment shift came as something of a surprise to hosts and managers using the home-booking platform who say they are finding it harder and harder to book guests. Ric Kenworthy, who manages 96 short-rental property listings through a company, Old Town Rental, in Arizona, was scrambling to fill unbooked units ahead of last month's Super Bowl in Glendale. ""We ended up at, let's just assume midday Saturday before the Super Bowl, close to 90% booked for all of our properties,"" Kenworthy told Yahoo Finance, later adding: ""Some key markets are experiencing quite a bit of saturation."" Kenworthy said he ended up cutting his listing prices by 50%: The going-rate for one of his rental properties went for $450-$600 a night that weekend after he'd been anticipating a rate closer to $1,000 a night given the demand generally created by an event like the Super Bowl. ""In 2022, we saw new heights in demand on the Airbnb platform and the result is continued growth in typical Host income, which was over $14,000 in the US,"" Sam Randall, a representative for Airbnb, told Yahoo Finance in a statement. ""We continue to invest in the success of our Host community and in the coming months will release new pricing tools to help them set competitive prices."" While some Airbnb hosts may not be feeling the full benefits, there is little doubt travel demand is back in full swing. Despite sticky inflation, consumers are booking trips: Data from a Bank of America Institute survey shows money spent on airline travel per household jumped 3.5% in January while international spending also increased compared to two years ago. ""I think the psychological impact of being locked down for some portion of the pandemic has only accelerated the trend that had already started,"" Marriott International (MAR) CEO Anthony Capuano told Yahoo Finance Live after the company's fourth-quarter earnings results showed the average room rates up 13% and revenue earned per average room jumping 29% year over year. Airbnb posted revenue of $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter, better than analyst expectations for revenues of $1.86 billion. The company's earnings per share also topped estimates, coming in at $0.48 cents against $0.08 forecasted. On the company's earnings call, CEO Brian Chesky told analysts Airbnb experienced ""tremendous growth"" in units listed online, ending 2022 with 6.6 million active listings. That was 16% higher compared to the previous year. Chesky attributed the increase in supply to two factors: demand and systematic improvements to their platform. As people flocked back to traveling, nights and experiences booked increased 20% in the fourth quarter, with active bookers in the fourth quarter reaching a record for the company. ""[Annual] revenue of $8.4 billion grew 40% year-over-year,"" Chesky said on the earnings call. ""And when you exclude foreign exchange, our revenue increased by 46% year-over-year."" The average daily rate for an Airbnb accommodation grew 36% compared to 2019 levels, according to CFO David Stephenson. He noted that it's generally ""more expensive"" to stay at an Airbnb than other accommodations and projected rates would come down ""modestly"" through the end of this year. ""We're not seeing any major shifts in overall kind of utilization rate that give us any concern,"" Stephenson said. ""We feel like we continue to keep, in aggregate, this nice balance of growing supply and growing demand, and we want to keep that relative balance."" Airbnb also stressed that the company is focused on three strategic priorities: raising awareness of hosting, upgrading core services, and scaling services beyond its core offerings. In late 2022, Airbnb added short-term sublet listings in an effort to grow its footprint among the multifamily market. The company asserted landlords and property managers using the sublet service could earn about 20% of the booking revenue. Airbnb also rolled out new categories, including one called ""OMG,"" which captures the most unique and exclusive accommodations. And after a Wall Street Journal report highlighted how some travelers were frustrated with host-mandated chore lists and the app's pricing format leading to sneaky costs, Airbnb launched a feature to show users price totals that include cleaning, service, and other fees. Looking ahead, some wonder about the sustainability of Airbnb's boom. “Can the top line demand persist? And then given their growth and supply, can the average rates [hold]?,” Nick Jones, research analyst at JMP Securities, told Yahoo Finance. ""If the demand wanes, that's going to increase available supply at any given day, which then... should result in lower prices, which then would impact their profitability."" Even if demand plateaus, the situation could change: January data from AirDNA suggested that rapid listing growth ""outpaced rising demand"" in 2022. ""U.S. short-term rentals earned over $62 billion ($141 billion globally) throughout the year (up 25.1% YoY), with almost 200 million nights stayed and over two million listings receiving at least one booking,"" AirDNA stated. ""Overall occupancy ended the year at 58.7%, a significant drop from the 61.3% in 2021."" In any case, as travel evolves after the pandemic bust and boom, some Airbnb hosts see a shift in consumer behavior. Michelle Burson, owner of a 4,000 square-foot Airbnb in Brookings, Oregon, is experiencing less foot traffic for her rental unit. ""Our bookings [have] declined last year compared to the previous year,"" Burson said. In Burson's view, ""one of the reasons was people were taking their traditional vacations…going to Hawaii, Europe, rather than driving, [or taking] road trips."" And Masha Löfstedt, who owns three rental properties in Oregon, struggled to get her property booked ahead of the holiday season. ""One of our houses that rents out all the time, nobody's booked for this weekend. That's like the first time in years,"" Löfstedt told Yahoo Finance in late 2022.

While I really enjoyed watching Salesforce and C3.ai shares explode higher post earnings last week, hot movers along these lines have been too few and far between (in either direction) in recent weeks. But if you take a step back and level set the stock market today, the muted action kind of makes a great deal of sense. Investors are facing a fresh dilemma — call it paralysis by analysis amid all the incoming data flying in. On the one hand, we have hot retail sales and inflation reports from the government — both calling into question whether the Federal Reserve is moving fast enough to squash inflation. On the other end of the spectrum, the jobs market continues to be solid (as probably seen in this week's jobs report). Yet, when you look at fourth quarter earnings (and conference calls) from Best Buy, Home Depot, Target and other retailers, you will see consumer weakness in big ticket merchandise. Dig into Target's earnings, and you will see a shopper trading down to cheaper private label goods because they are less inflationary and they just got laid off by a tech company. Taken together, this is a confusing time to be an investor – something market maven Keith Lerner at Truist captures in a new note he sent me: ""The recent action is very much aligned with a key market dilemma we have been highlighting: If the economy stays stronger, as we have seen recently, Fed policy is set to remain tighter, and this will weigh on market valuations. Or, instead, if the economy weakens, this will pressure profits. Neither of these outcomes are favorable for premium market valuations."" In other words, Mr. Market doesn't know what he wants! And if you think all the bad news of any kind is priced into stocks, Lerner adds these considerations: ""For perspective, the S&P 500’s forward P/E of 17.6x is still slightly above the 10-year average of 17.2x, and that’s in the context of a high degree of uncertainty around economic growth, inflation, and earnings. Forward earnings estimates are hovering near a 52- week low, and downside risks remain. The 1-year U.S. Treasury yield has jumped above 5% for the first time since 2007, and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which is hovering around 4%, is nearly double the average of the past decade.""

2023-03-04,amzn,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/bankman-fried-flip-phone-limited-153437236.html,"By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sam Bankman-Fried should be allowed while on bail to have a flip phone with no internet capability and a basic laptop with limited functions, but be forbidden from using other electronic communication devices, the U.S. Department of Justice said. The proposal to limit the indicted FTX cryptocurrency exchange founder's communications was filed late on Friday in Manhattan federal court, on behalf of the government and Bankman-Fried's defense team. It requires approval by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who oversees the case. Kaplan had signaled at a Feb. 16 hearing that he might jail the 30-year-old Bankman-Fried for testing the limits of his $250 million bail package by communicating in ways that could not be monitored. The judge said he did not want to set Bankman-Fried ""loose in this garden of electronic devices,"" following accusations that Bankman-Fried tried to contact possible government witnesses and used a virtual private network to watch football. Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty after prosecutors said he stole billions of dollars of FTX customer funds to plug losses at his Alameda Research hedge fund. He faces 12 criminal charges under an indictment made public on Feb. 23. The proposed flip phone or other non-smartphone for Bankman-Fried would be limited to voice calls and SMS text messages. Laptop internet use would be restricted to specified virtual private networks, 23 websites for personal use including news, sports and food delivery, and websites to help Bankman-Fried prepare for his scheduled Oct. 2 trial. Bankman-Fried is living under house arrest with his parents, both Stanford Law School professors, in Palo Alto, California. The parents agreed to submit sworn affidavits that they would not bring other electronic devices into their home or let their son use theirs. They also agreed that each device would carry software that periodically takes videos or photos of the user, which court officers would be allowed to review, the letter said. Bankman-Fried's lawyers did not immediately respond on Saturday to requests for comment. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York and Anirudh Saligrama in Bengaluru; Editing by Daniel Wallis)"
2023-03-03,amzn,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-march-3-2023-133941006.html,"U.S. stocks rallied on Friday, rounding out a big end to the week, while bond yields retreated slightly from their recent march. At the close, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) surged 1.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) increased 1.1%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 2%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note (^TNX) moved back and forth around the key 4% level Friday, eventually settling below the line, after services data showed economic activity expanded in February. Crude oil traded higher, with U.S. benchmark WTI (CL=F) up at $79.71 a barrel. On the economic data side, economic activity in the services sector grew in February for the second consecutive month as the ISM Services PMI came in at 55.1, slightly lower from 55.2 recorded in January and above economist expectations of 54.5. February's ISM Services figures ""suggests activity continues to expand at a reasonably healthy pace, but provides further reason to doubt the idea that there has been a resurgence in growth since the start of the year,"" Andrew Hunter, deputy chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note following the release. The moves come after the Federal Reserve published a semiannual Monetary Policy Report to Congress that details the central bank's plans to hike interest rates as a means to restore price stability. Officials indicated ""that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2% over time,"" the Fed said in its report. Stocks rallied on Thursday, with the S&P 500 trading lower for most of the session before rallying after commentary from Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic. Bostic said he’s still open to raising rates by another quarter percentage point at the central bank’s March meeting. “I let the data guide me,” Bostic told reporters in a press briefing. “If the data continue to come in suggesting the economy is stronger than I had projected, I’ll adjust my policy trajectory.” Bostic, who isn’t a voter on monetary policy this year, wrote an essay on Wednesday calling for the Fed to raise its policy rate by 50 basis points to a range of 5%-5.25% and then keep it there until well into 2024. Fed officials raised the benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point in February, pulling the target to stand in a range of 4.5%-4.75%. Policymakers will be releasing new projections after the central bank’s March 21-22 meeting. In single stock moves, C3.ai (AI) shares surged over 30% Friday after the company posted fiscal third quarter revenue that came at $66.7 million, beating analyst expectations of $64.2 million. Shares of Rivian (RIVN) jumped after the EV maker said on Friday it's keeping to the original production forecast of 50,000 vehicles in 2023. Costco (COST) shares sank 2% after the bulk retailer posted mixed results for the second quarter. Total revenue for its latest quarter was $55.27 billion, slightly below analysts' expectations of $55.58 billion. During the earnings call, the company provided some hopeful news on the inflation front. ChargePoint (CHPT) shares were down Friday after the maker of EV charging stations reported disappointing results and issued softer guidance. Shares of Amazon (AMZN) were up 3% as the company pauses construction on its second quarters in Arlington, Virginia. The move follows the tech giant's announcements of job cuts in the wake of slowing consumer and corporate spending. Marvell Technology (MRVL) stock fell after the company reported mixed results, with earnings in line with expectations but guidance weaker than forecasted. Shares of Meta Platforms (META) surged 6% as the company announced it would slash prices of its Quest Pro virtual-reality headset after the product launch. In the cryptocurrency market, both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) fell as customers pull their funds from crypto bank Silvergate (SI), whose stock plunged more than 57% during the trading session on Thursday. Following the drop in Bitcoin, the pullback is close to 10% and the digital asset was on pace to close below its 50-day moving average for the first time in almost two months, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-02,amzn,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-today-march-2-2023-135533324.html,"Stocks rallied on Thursday with the Dow leading markets higher as results from Salesforce (CRM) lifted the index, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq shook off early losses to finish in the green. At the close on Thursday, the S&P 500 was up 0.76%, the Nasdaq higher by 0.73%, and the blue chip Dow up 1.05%. Rates remained a key focus for investors, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note settling north of 4%, its highest level since November. The rise in yields has come as investors brace for more aggressive action from the Federal Reserve in the coming months as inflation stays elevated and the economy remains strong. On the front end of the Treasury curve, the yield on 2-year notes continued to trade near its highest level since 2007. The 2-year yield, which stood near 4.8% on Thursday, is seen as the best proxy for investor expectations of the Fed's near-term path for interest rates. In single-stock moves, shares of Salesforce rose 11.5% on Thursday as investors cheered the company's latest quarterly report, which saw the embattled Dow member double down on cost-cutting initiatives and shareholder return plans. The stock's opening gap higher of 16% was its largest since Aug. 2020, according to data from Bloomberg. In an interview with Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi late Wednesday, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in reference to the company's efficiency initiatives: ""We have hit the hyper-space button."" The company announced in its quarterly report an increase in its share repurchase authorization to $20 billion, with COO Brian Millham telling investors on a call, ""We're inspecting every part of our business to find opportunities to drive efficiencies and reduce cost of sales, marketing, and G&A."" Salesforce's 11.5% jump, good for jsut over a $19 per share increase in the stock price, added roughly 110 points to the price-weighted Dow's 340 point gain on Thursday. Elsewhere in single-stock moves, shares of troubled bank Silvergate (SI) fell 57% on Thursday after the company delayed the filing of its annual report and said it would likely report losses larger than those previously disclosed. The bank took on several high-profile crypto clients in recent years and has seen its share price collapse by more than 90% in the wake of the failure of FTX, among other crypto bankruptcies. Tesla (TSLA) shares were also in focus on Thursday, falling 5.9% as the electric carmaker held its latest investor day on Wednesday, which revealed few new product details but emphasized the company's push to unlock new efficiencies in its manufacturing and design processes. On the economic data side, the weekly report on initial jobless claims showed 190,000 new filings for unemployment insurance were made last week, the latest sign the labor market remains robust. Though tomorrow marks the first Friday of the month, the February jobs report will not be released until March 10.

2023-03-02,amzn,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/mortgage-rates-surge-closer-to-7-170022384.html,"Mortgage rates jumped higher this week, getting even closer to 7% and crushing homebuyer activity, which hit a 28-year low. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage increased to 6.65% from 6.50% the week prior, according to Freddie Mac. Rates have climbed over a half-point in February, reversing declines since mid-November. The spike in rates is another blow to would-be buyers, who are also facing still-high home prices and a shortage of affordable homes for sale. Sellers also appear to be pulling their listings, rather than cutting prices further to spur interest. “I think the biggest concern is buying into a market that would continue to go down,” Jeff Reynolds, broker at Compass and founder of UrbanCondoSpaces, recently told Yahoo Finance. “In my 18-year career, I have never seen rate moves like we are seeing now.” The volume of applications to purchase a home slid by 6% from one week earlier, the Mortgage Bankers Association’s survey of applications for the week ending Feb. 24 found. Overall, demand was 44% lower than the same week a year ago and has nosedived to a 28-year low. The drop in demand registered this past month is a sign that affordability remains a top concern, according to Redfin Deputy Chief Economist Taylor Marr. “The housing market took two steps forward in December and January, but has taken one step back in February,” Marr said in a statement. “Mortgage rates crept back this month, which is prompting more buyers and sellers to back off.” Another reason for the pullback in demand is rising home prices. The national median list price increased to $415,000 in February, Realtor.com data showed, up from $406,000 in January. While that’s down 7.6% from June’s peak of $449,000 – it still represents a yearly growth rate of 7.8%. That translates to out-of-pocket costs for buyers. According to Realtor.com, the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home is roughly $630 higher than a year ago. That puts the monthly mortgage payment 45.1% higher than a year ago, exceeding rent growth, up 2.9% from a year ago, and inflation, up 6.4%. As rates continue to climb, fewer home sellers are active this year. The number of newly-listed homes for sale declined by 15.9% in February compared with the previous year, Realtor.com data found. That’s a larger rate of decline versus January’s 10.4% decrease, but a small improvement from November and December. Overall, new listings remained 27% below pre-pandemic 2017 to 2019 levels. According to Redfin, existing homeowners don’t want to move because they don’t want to give up their ultra-low mortgage rates. As of February, approximately 85% of mortgage holders have a rate far below 6%. Homeowners may also be hesitant to put their homes on the market due to soft homebuyer demand that’s forcing sellers to cut prices. “We'll find out in the next 30 days if buyers are getting used to higher rates,” Reynolds said, “or if they will stay on the sideline waiting for rates to come back to earth.” Gabriella is a personal finance reporter at Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-02,amzn,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/what-the-end-of-the-great-moderation-era-means-for-investors-morning-brief-103057491.html,"This article first appeared in the Morning Brief.

Subscribe Thursday, March 2, 2023 Today's newsletter is by Jared Blikre, a reporter focused on the markets on Yahoo Finance. Follow him on Twitter @SPYJared. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. In 2004, then-Fed chair Ben Bernanke gave a speech titled, ""The Great Moderation."" His thesis: ""One of the most striking features of the economic landscape over the past twenty years or so has been a substantial decline in macroeconomic volatility."" And while the Global Financial Crisis dented this belief, a post-crisis economic recovery and stock market boom brought these ideas back into vogue among many investors who rode a ""stocks only go up"" rally for more than a decade. But with inflation at multi-decade highs and interest rates at their highest levels in over 15 years, some investors are saying that the old investing epoch has come to an end — ushering in a new era where fundamentals matter, traditional savers are rewarded once again, and the volatility that Bernanke said goodbye to is back. In other words, choppier waters might be the new norm for a while. There are a few things that are starkly different about this present business cycle, Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, told Yahoo Finance Live Wednesday. First, there's the hot labor market, despite the white-collar layoffs. Historically, it's the lower-wage workers that are first in line to get cut. ""Yet another thing about this cycle that is just so different relative to past cycles,"" Saunders said. To date, this downturn has been felt mostly at the upper ends of the wealth spectrum, with asset prices like stocks, bonds, and real estate suffering declines. Meanwhile, inflation is a pernicious problem that disproportionately affects lower incomes. But it has not yet become entrenched — at least in the eyes of policy makers. Investors may not know what to think, but Sonders expects the current fog to lift a bit when we get the next batch of quarterly reports in April. But it might not be a clarity worth celebrating. Analysts have already been lowering the bar for the first quarter earnings, and Sonders believes they have a ways to go considering the bond market is signaling the Fed needs to be yet more aggressive. ""One of the factors most highly correlated to corporate earnings is the 10-year [U.S. Treasury] yield, with a lag,"" she says. Sonders believes the 10-year yield is forecasting the Fed will need to keep rates higher for longer, and that ""the path of least resistance for [earnings estimates] is down"" — targeting the first half of this year. Whether or not that near-term pain materializes, Sonders closes the door on the prior epoch of declining rates and volatility, then describes what investors can expect in the years to come. ""I think that the end of the Great Moderation era is very much here ... Gone are the days of cheap access to goods, cheap access to energy, [and] cheap access to labor. I think all three of those ships have sailed,"" she says. Sonders argues that reversing the engine of globalization and reorienting toward regionalism will have profound investing implications over the secular time frame. ""I would therefore expect greater inflation volatility, economic volatility, [and] geopolitical volatility. We're in this era of regionalization and demographic shifts that are pretty painful."" But as painful as these changes are for workers, consumers and investors alike, there are opportunities for investors. Consider that the Fed has finally raised short-term rates — the so-called risk-free rate — to levels that prevailed in decades prior. ""With the return of the risk-free [Treasury] rate, it's brought secular changes, including the fact that fundamentals are reattaching to prices,"" says Sonders. She goes on to explain that the market is no longer skewed so heavily toward mega cap stocks, and that there's hope for stock pickers once again after over a decade of underperformance. ""This has important implications and helps explain why equal-weighted [stock indices] have generally been doing better than [market] cap-weighted [indices] — why active [investing] has been doing better than passive [investing] — or at least is on a more level playing field with passive. And I think those are secular and as important backdrops for investors to think about.""

2023-03-02,amzn,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/silvergate-stock-crashes-after-company-delays-annual-report-reveals-new-losses-121923800.html,"Shares of troubled lender Silvergate (SI) fell 57% on Thursday after the company said late Wednesday it will miss a March 16 deadline to file its already-delayed annual report. The bank said its team ""requires additional time to perform analysis, record journal entries related to subsequent events and to complete management’s evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting."" ""The Company is currently analyzing certain regulatory and other inquiries and investigations that are pending with respect to the Company,"" the company added. Silvergate shares have collapsed over the last year as the company's entanglements with several crypto firms — including bankrupt exchange FTX, among others — resulted in deposits falling by more than two-thirds in the fourth quarter of last year. In January, the company laid off 40% of its staff. The company later suspended a dividend paid on preferred shares as it sought to shore up cash. Over the last year, shares of the bank have lost more than 95%. A spokesperson for Silvergate told Yahoo Finance: ""Silvergate is working diligently to file its 10-K as soon as possible and has no further comment at this time."" In Wednesday's notice, the bank said it sold additional debt securities beyond what was previously anticipated in January and February and it expects to record further losses than what was previously disclosed. In January, the company disclosed it took $887 million worth of non-interest losses in the fourth quarter. The sales are primarily to repay ""outstanding advances"" it received from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, Silvergate said. The bank also needs additional time to complete an ""evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting"" being conducted by its third party accounting firm. Citing business and regulatory challenges, the company is weighing how much the changes might affect its ""ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements,"" according to the filing. In late January, a bi-partisan group of U.S. Senators pressed the company to provide answers over whether it was aware its clients FTX misused customer funds. A Reuters report in February said a Silvergate account controlled by Binance.US moved millions of dollars to a company controlled by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. Last week in a joint statement with the Federal Deposit and Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve made a point to highlight the heightened liquidity risks for banks taking on crypto-related clients. As for its own risks, Silvergate cited “heightened regulatory scrutiny of banking institutions that provide products and services to the digital asset industry,"" private litigation, and investigations from congressional inquiries, banking regulators and the Justice Department. Analysts at JPMorgan downgraded the stock to Underweight from Neutral and withdrew their its price target in a note out Thursday, calling the situation ""highly unusual"" and adding: ""The 'run' experienced at Silvergate appears to have been driven by a combination of (1) trust in the overall system being shaken given the collapse of previously trusted players (such as FTX) and (2) short-sellers voicing concerns (primarily on Twitter).""

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) declined by 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was flat. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell by 0.6%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note moved upward and briefly touched 4% Wednesday. Crude oil traded higher, with U.S. benchmark WTI up at $77.73 a barrel. On the economic data side, U.S. manufacturing firms signaled a grim outlook for the sector, according to the latest PMI data from S&P Global. The seasonally adjusted S&P Global US Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index was revised lower to 47.3 in February, up from 46.9 in January. The reading indicates ""a solid deterioration in the health of the goods-producing sector, despite the pace of decline softening to the slowest for three months."" Separately, economic activity in the manufacturing sector diminished in February for the fourth consecutive month following a 28-month period of growth, according to the Institute for Supply Management report on business. The data offered a mixed bag. Employment in manufacturing decreased to 49.10 in February from 50.60 in January. New orders rose to 47.0 compared to January's figure of 42.5. Prices paid jumped to 51.3 from January's reading of 44.5. Stocks fell Tuesday, rounding out the last day of a volatile month of February on Wall Street. According to JP Morgan’s trading desk, February’s month-end rebalance drove some weakness in equities and strength in bonds Tuesday afternoon. With February in the rearview, the S&P 500 remains up more than 3% this year, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group. Mega-caps have been a massive driver of the index moves. That said, 20 of the largest stocks in the S&P 500 have accounted for most of the index’s gains. Now, as the calendar turns, March historically sees the S&P 500’s gains in the second half of the month, Bespoke Investment Group noted. The path of the Federal Reserve's rate hikes remains in focus for investors. Two Federal Reserve officials spoke on Wednesday leaned in the move that aggressive interest rate hikes are the path forward to ease inflation. They followed Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, who said on Tuesday it would be a “danger and a mistake for policy makers to rely too heavily on market reactions” and emphasized the importance to “supplement these traditional data with observations on the ground from the real economy.” However, Goolsbee, who will be a voter at this year’s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting, didn’t comment on monetary policy. Since last year, the Fed has sharply raised rates in an effort to cool inflation. But inflation remains sticky. Policymakers will be releasing new projections after the central bank’s March 21-22 meeting. On the housing front, mortgage rates continue to move upward, pushing buyers to the sidelines as the spring housing market is underway. Both purchase and refinance applications slumped last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index. Volume of purchase applications hit a 28-year low, down 44% from a year ago. Here are some of the tickers trending on Yahoo Finance today:  Eli Lilly and Company (LLY): The drugmaker announced Wednesday morning it expects to cap out-of-pocket cost of its insulin at $35 a month. The plan comes as a promise to provide critical relief to some people with diabetes, who at times face higher medical costs.

""I hate the noise,"" Solomon said bluntly. ""I live in the same neighborhood as you all live in and I wish the noise was different."" Various media reports of mass partner exits, coupled with recent Wall Street chatter the bank has lost its way after the failure of its consumer banking project Marcus, have all contributed to unfavorable sentiment. And this coming after the company laid off some 3,200 workers positions, or a little over 6% of its headcount, in January after a challenging 2022. Solomon admitted mistakes were made, telling investors: ""I think we’ve accomplished a lot over the past few years. We got some things right, got some things wrong."" ""I read things in the paper that don’t match what’s happening inside the firm,"" Solomon continued, explaining there were fewer partner transitions in 2022 than any other year going back to 2014. ""The culture of Goldman Sachs is incredibly strong. ...We have an extraordinary group of people working incredibly hard,"" he said. ""We also recognize we've gone through a very unusual period over last 3 years — the pandemic was a very tough thing on a culture like ours."" Goldman Sachs shares, down about 5% over the past month, are trading relatively flat year-to-date — underperforming the S&P 500's 3% gain over that same time period. Solomon went on to note Goldman is a ""human business,"" explaining the firm has made conscious decisions to invest in its culture with leadership spending more time with partners throughout the year to help push a greater sense of community throughout the organization. ""We’re going to continue to invest in our culture. I think it's very good, [but] I do think we've had dramatic shifts,"" he said, once again referencing the pandemic which was quickly followed by an unfavorable macro environment. ""That created more noise, more grumbling than usual."" Overall, ""I feel good about the partnerships [and] the culture, but that doesn't mean we don't have to keep investing,"" he reiterated. Goldman saw a rough end to 2022 with profits down a whopping 69% in Q4 amid a serious decline in deal-making revenues, pressured by a weakening economic backdrop. Following Tuesday's presentation, analyst reaction appeared cautiously optimistic, although questions remain over the path to profitability for its consumer banking unit, otherwise known as platform solutions. Shares of Goldman fell about 4% on Tuesday as the company made its pitch to investors. ""Coming out of the conference, the buzz among investors was whether GS will grow the consumer businesses or sell parts of them. Our interpretation of management's commentary is that both options are on the table,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck wrote in a new note published on Wednesday. Graseck maintained her Equal Weight rating and reiterated a 12-month price target of $332 a share. Graseck added all three business segments, which also includes investment banking and trading along with wealth and asset management, ""have an opportunity to contribute to Y/Y EPS growth as GS targets growth opportunities and gets more efficient."" Goldman reported a net loss of $660 million in its platform solutions unit in the fourth quarter with a full-year net loss settling at $1.67 billion. The company blamed the decline on higher provisions for credit losses, but stressed on Tuesday: ""Profitability is not a strategy. It is a priority and the outcome of a strategy well executed."" Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala told clients Wednesday Goldman's profitability push seemed genuine, writing: ""While investors looking for instant gratification may have been disappointed, we believe that management is on the same page with shareholders in that it appreciates the need to further shrink its consumer exposure ""unlock value"" (specifically, card partnerships and point-of-sale lending)."" Poonawala maintained a Buy rating and reiterated a $384 price target on the stock. Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-01,amzn,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/feds-bostic-kashkari-call-for-higher-rates-after-concerning-inflation-jobs-data-150224928.html,"Two Federal Reserve officials speaking Wednesday said more aggressive interest rate hikes are likely necessary to slow inflation, as is the central bank keeping rates at elevated levels for some time. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said Wednesday he is remaining ""open-minded"" about whether the Fed should raise rates by 25 or 50 basis points at its next policy meeting on March 21-22. Markets currently expect a 25 basis point, or 0.25%, rate increase from the central bank. ""I’m open-minded about whether it's 25 or 50 basis points [at the next meeting],"" Kashkari said during a Q&A at a Sioux Falls Business CEO event. ""What's more important is what we signal in the dot plot."" The Fed will release a new set of economic forecasts and interest rate expectations alongside its March 22 policy statement. Kashkari said in December, he jotted down raising interest rates up to 5.4% and holding rates at that level for an extended period. ""At this point I haven't decided what my dot is, but I would lean towards continuing to raise further that I would continue to push up my policy path."" ""Given the data in the last month — higher inflation than we expected and a strong jobs report — these are concerning data points suggesting we're not making progress as quickly as we'd like,"" Kashkari said. ""At the same time shouldn't overreact to one month of data even if the data is troubling."" Kashkari is a voting member of the FOMC, the Fed committee that sets monetary policy, in 2023. Elsewhere, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said Wednesday he believes the Fed needs to raise its policy rate by 50 basis points, to a range of 5%-5.25%, and hold it at that level until well into 2024. ""We must determine when inflation is irrevocably moving lower,"" Bostic wrote in an essay published Wednesday. ""We're not there yet. That's why I think we need to raise the federal funds rate to between 5-5.25% and leave it there well into 2024. This will allow tighter policy to filter through the economy and ultimately bring aggregate supply and aggregate demand into better balance and thus lower inflation."" Bostic is not a voting member of the FOMC in 2023, but will be a voting member in 2024. Bostic said in order to consider reversing the course of monetary policy, he needs to see a better balance in the job market between labor supply and demand and see broad-based inflation narrow. Bostic noted about half of the goods in the CPI market basket still show inflation rates of 6% or higher. The Fed targets inflation that averages 2%. ""If we are going to get inflation back in the range of our target, the breadth of inflation will have to narrow considerably,"" Bostic wrote. ""When inflation is no longer top of mind, our mission will largely be accomplished. We are clearly not there yet. But I—and the Committee—are committed to doing all we can to ensure that we get there as soon as possible."" Both Bostic and Kashkari noted that while the increase in interest rates has slowed the housing and real estate sectors, they aren’t seeing many signs higher rates are really slowing down the rest of the economy. ""Business contacts tell us activity may well soften, but they don't anticipate a severe deterioration,"" Bostic wrote. ""When businesses think customers will buy less of their product or service in the near and medium term, then they will adjust hiring and investment plans accordingly."" Kashkari said the U.S is not in recession right now pointing to strong job growth, but said whether the Fed can avoid causing a recession with its interest rate hikes to fight inflation — a so-called soft-landing —remains an open question. ""The track record is not good at being able to slow down the economy this much without going a little too far and heading into recession,"" he said. ""[But] typically, when the central bank has caused a recession by raising interest rates, the bounce back can be very fast."" Kashkari said the dynamics in this economic cycle are different given families and states have strong balance sheets and supply chains are getting better. Both Fed officials said the cost of raising rates too much outweighs the costs of raising rates too little, adding the Fed must avoid a 1970s scenario in which the central bank cut rates too soon, causing inflation to re-surge and forcing the Volcker-led Fed to hike rates much higher to ultimately bring down inflation.

Follow him on Twitter @MylesUdland and on LinkedIn. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. U.S. consumers and the executives that Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon talks to have a lot in common — they feel good about today and worse about tomorrow. New data out from The Conference Board on Tuesday showed consumer confidence dipped in February, with the decline entirely driven by expectations. The Conference Board's index fell to 102.9 in February from 106 in January and 109 in December; December's reading was the highest since Sept. 2021. Underneath the surface of this decline, however, was another month where a strong labor market lifted consumers' current expectations while fears about the future loomed. ""The present situation index rose for a third straight month, underpinned by upbeat views on employment and business conditions,"" wrote Gurleen Chadha, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, in a note to clients on Tuesday. ""That index rose 1.7pts to 152.8. The differential between jobs 'plentiful' and jobs 'hard to get' rose to 41.5ppts, the highest since April 2022, indicating that current labor market conditions are still quite tight."" In January, the U.S. economy added a surprising 517,000 jobs while the unemployment rate stood at 3.4%. Meanwhile, speaking at Goldman's second-ever investor day on Tuesday, Solomon said the executives he spends his days speaking with are feeling better about a ""soft landing"" for the economy, but that inflation worries are ""hampering confidence."" ""When I talk to CEOs, they feel more uncertain about the course of inflation as we run through 2023, 2024. ...There's a real belief that inflation will be stickier and harder to moderate than markets now predict,"" Solomon said. The Conference Board's data shows consumers remain pleasantly surprised the soft labor market they'd braced for hasn't materialized just as executives fretting over recession remain similarly relieved. And yet both groups in their own way remain braced for some version of economic impact. It's just not clear that hasn't already happened. We're coming off a year in which the S&P 500 fell 19%, the price of gas in the U.S. hit $5 a gallon, and the inflation rate reached 9.1%. In less than a year, the Fed has raised interest rates 4.5%. The housing market got crushed. And the most popular investing strategy for those saving for retirement endured its worst year on record. All things that have improved in 2023. And if there's one theme that been pervasive in markets and the economy for some time now it's a sense from investors and consumers that the worst is yet to come. Economists at Wells Fargo said in a note consumer confidence data ""pours some cold water on the streak of strong economic data received to start the year."" Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, said Tuesday, ""if consumers drive the economy, the outlook for 2023 is bleak as the consumers expect that the worst is yet to come."" On Tuesday, The Conference Board's Expectations Index stood at 69.7, notable as any reading below 80 is typically consistent with recession, according to the report. This index, however, has been below 80 for 11 of the last 12 months. And we wait for the recession still. Solomon said there is typically a ""4 to 6 quarter lag before people reset their expectations."" The question, then, is in which direction do consumers and businesses need to reset expectations against those held today. And, once they do, will it already be too late?

2023-02-28,amzn,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-february-28-2023-120603661.html,"U.S. stocks fell Tuesday, rounding out the last day of a volatile month of February on Wall Street. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) edged lower by 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined 0.7%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ticked down by 0.1%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked up to 3.92% Tuesday afternoon. The U.S. benchmark WTI crude oil moved higher to trade around $76.94 a barrel. The dollar index was up, trading at $104.92. Stocks closed higher on Monday, fueling a temporary rebound from Wall Street's worst week of the year. All three indexes ended February in the red after an optimistic start to the year in January. Economic data released on Tuesday showed that retail inventories, excluding auto, rose 0.3%, higher than 0.1% expected by economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Meanwhile, wholesale inventories declined 0.4%, below consensus estimates of 0.1%. American consumers felt worse about the economy in February, the Confidence Board reported. The board's Consumer Confidence Index slumped to 102.9 from 106.0, below consensus estimates of 108.5,  Meanwhile, February Chicago PMI dipped to 43.6 from 44.3, also below consensus expectations. “Consumers and businesses are looking for ways to reduce expenses in anticipation of much weaker activity over the rest of the year. The drop in consumer confidence in February aligns with weaker business confidence readings as the Fed’s sharp increase in interest rates start to bite,"" Ben Ayers, Nationwide senior economist, wrote in a statement. Other data showed that home prices fell 0.5% in December, according to data from S&P Corelogic Case-Shiller Index. On a yearly basis, home prices rose 4.6%, lower than analysts' expectations of 4.8%. As inflation still remains sticky, Federal Reserve Governor Philip Jefferson on Monday shot down arguments for raising the central bank’s 2% inflation target and said he is under ""no illusion"" that it's going to be easy to get the inflation rate back down. This week, investors will remain focused on the retail sector. On Tuesday, earnings from Target (TGT) topped analysts' expectations as consumer spending continues to move away from discretionary categories. The retailer’s same-store sales grew by 0.7%, above estimates of a 1.74% decline. The stock rose about 1% on Tuesday. Data from Bespoke Investment Group showed that over the last week, 420 stocks have reported earnings and the percentage of companies lowering guidance is more than double the percentage raising guidance, signaling ""lots of trouble for these smaller-cap companies that report late in the season."" In other single stock moves, Zoom (ZM) shares rose after the company posted better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings, with earnings per share of $1.22 higher than estimates of 80 cents. Revenue came in at $1.12 billion. Occidental Petroleum (OXY) shares moved down on Tuesday after the oil and gas producer posted fourth-quarter results that came in below Wall Street expectations on revenue and earnings per share. Shares of Workday (WDAY) were up after the human-resources software company topped expectations with revenue of $1.65 billion, up 20% year-over-year, against estimates of $1.63 billion. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (AMC) fell jumped on Tuesday after a Delaware court said it would hold a hearing on April 27, which will likely delay the date of conversion of convertible units APE to common stock. Tesla (TSLA) shares fell around 1% as Mexico's president confirmed that the EV maker will build a new plant in Monterrey, Mexico. The Mexican president said more details will be released at Tesla's investor day, and he said the plant is expected to be ""very big."" Shares of Coinbase (COIN) surged as fears of crypto regulation begin to fade. On Monday, the company was served a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission as the regulatory agency cracks down on cryptocurrency listings, its custody of digital assets and platform operations, and more, the company disclosed. Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) shares sank after the company reported a wider-than-expected loss and forecasted disappointing guidance for 2023 as the cruise operator gets squeezed by soaring fuel and labor costs. Separately, Bank of Nova Scotia shares dropped after the Canadian lender reported a missed in earnings estimates as a lull in its investment banking division dented income from its capital markets unit. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. Today the process opens for semiconductor companies to apply for a piece of the $39 billion grant money being allocated as part of the CHIPS and Science Act. But there's a catch: firms that win the funds may not be able to buy back stock – for a while, anyway. “We want to make sure that their money is being used to increase research and development in innovation and not to pad their bottom line or do buybacks,” said Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in an interview with Yahoo Finance. One could argue it’s the administration’s prerogative to decide how chipmakers that accept grants to build factories use that money. But the White House wants to go further, by boosting taxes on buybacks from their current 1%. In his State of the Union address earlier this month, President Joe Biden said that tax should be much higher: ""Corporations ought to do the right thing. That’s why I propose we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks and encourage long-term investments. They’ll still make considerable profit."" That proposal is what may have led Warren Buffett to weigh in on the hot-button issue in the Berkshire Hathaway CEO’s annual letter to investors: “When you are told that all repurchases are harmful to shareholders or to the country, or particularly beneficial to CEOs, you are listening to either an economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue (characters that are not mutually exclusive).” Even Buffett has a caveat, however: he says buybacks make sense only if they are made at “value-accretive prices,” i.e. when corporations don’t overpay. Taking a step back, corporations have a number of ways to spend their money, from building new plants to hiring people to research and development. They can also distribute the funds directly to shareholders by paying out dividends. Or they can repurchase shares, which has the effect of reducing overall share count, automatically increasing earnings per share. (In a simplified example, if a company makes $1 million in profit and has 50,000 shares outstanding, earnings per share are $20. If it buys back 10,000 of its shares, earnings per share go to $25, making an existing shareholder's stake more valuable.) And the numbers are a lot bigger than in the example above. Last year, U.S. companies announced a record $1.223 trillion of buybacks, according to data from EPFR TrimTabs. This year, it’s already running at $274.9 billion — heating up even after the 1% tax kicked in. Eliminating or restricting that tool, then, would be a big deal. Will it actually happen? In the case of companies accepting money as part of the CHIPS Act, it’s unclear whether they’ll be barred from doing buybacks at all, or just directly using the funding they’ve received. (Senator Elizabeth Warren and some of her colleagues in Congress want the participants to be barred from doing buybacks for 10 years). Secretary Raimondo said each case will be different, but the government will in theory have the ability to claw back money in the “most extreme cases” if companies do not comply with their agreements, whether that deals with buybacks or other stipulations. Investors in companies like Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) should take note, since they’re among the firms that have announced plans to build plants in the U.S. and are likely to apply for federal funding. As for whether a broader clampdown on buybacks is coming, policy analyst Ed Mills is skeptical. “Really, what this is about is setting up a strawman, as we get into debates about the debt ceiling,” Mills, a managing director at Raymond James, told Yahoo Finance in an interview. On the one hand, Republicans will fire up their rhetoric about getting the U.S. fiscal house in order. Democrats, led by President Biden, are likely to shoot back by saying Republicans aren’t willing to ask companies enacting big buybacks to pay more in taxes. “I don't think it happens, but I think it's going to be more part of the conversation than I think the market anticipates right now,” Mills said.

The Minneapolis-based retailer saw same-store sales increase by 0.7%, higher than Wall Street estimates of -1.74%. Similar to Walmart's (WMT) latest quarterly results, consumer spending at Target seemed to shift to essentials like food and away from categories like electronics, home, and apparel. Target shares jumped by more than 3.5% in pre-market trading after the report's release. Target CEO Brian Cornell said the team was pleased with the sales growth in what continues to be a ""very challenging environment."" Here's what Target reported, compared to Wall Street estimates, based on Bloomberg consensus data: Revenue: $31.40 billion versus $30.46 billion expected Adjusted earnings per share: $1.89 versus $1.48 expected Same-store sales: 0.7% versus -1.74% expected Brick & mortar same-store sales: up 1.9% versus -2.80% expected Cornell said having multiple category offerings, including food & beverage, in addition to beauty and household items served the retailer well this past quarter, Cornell said. ""Strength in Food & Beverage, Beauty and Household Essentials offset ongoing softness in discretionary categories. This performance highlights the benefit of our multi-category merchandise assortment, which drives relevance with our guests in any environment, and is a key reason we grew traffic every quarter last year."" Same-store sales beat estimates, up 0.7% compared to expectations of a decline of 1.74%. Same-store sales at physical locations also got a boost, up 1.9%, while digital sales dropped 3.6% in Q4. At the end of Q4, inventory was 3% lower than 2021. Meanwhile, in discretionary categories like electronics, home and apparel, inventory was nearly 13% lower than 2021, ""partially offset by higher inventory in frequency categories."" For full-year fiscal 2022 results, revenue grew by $3 billion, to $109 billion. Compared to 2019, revenue is up more than $30 billion. In the full-year, same-store sales increased 2.2%, while traffic was up 2.1%. Looking ahead to fiscal 2023, Cornell said the retailer is focused on it's long-term strategy and ""continued differentiation through affordability, assortment, ease and convenience"" as it competes with other retailers for consumers trading down. ""At the same time, we’re planning our business cautiously in the near term to ensure we remain agile and responsive to the current operating environment...as we plan for the year ahead, we will continue to make robust capital investments and pursue efficiency opportunities in support of our long-term growth."" For the first-quarter of 2023, the company expects a wide range for same-store sales, from a low-single digit decline to a low-single increase, and an operating income margin rate of 4-5%. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.50 to $1.90. For fiscal-year 2023, the company expects same-store sales to be the same, from low-single digit to a low-single increase, along with an operating income of more than $1 billion and adjusted EPS to range from $7.75 to $8.75. In the next 3 years, the company aims to move beyond its pre-pandemic operating income margin rate of 6%, and says it could possibly reach that goal as early as fiscal 2024, ""depending on the speed of recovery for the economy and consumer demand."" — Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-02-27,amzn,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-february-27-2023-130555308.html,"U.S. stocks rose on Monday, fueling a rebound from Wall Street's worst week of the year. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose by 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.2%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased by 0.6%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked down to 3.93% Monday. On the economic data side, new orders for manufactured durable goods in January plunged to 4.5%, the biggest drop since April 2020, the Census Bureau reported. The drop was more pronounced than economist estimates of 4.0%. ""The manufacturing sector will remain under pressure in the months ahead, but the details of January's report of durable goods orders and shipments suggest factory activity started the year on a better note than the headline figure would suggest,"" Lydia Boussour, EY Parthenon senior economist, wrote in a statement following the release. Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors’ index of pending home sales climbed 8.1% to 82.5 in January, sharply higher from the projected rise of 1.0% by Bloomberg economists, according to data the group released on Monday. On a yearly basis, however, pending transactions plunged by nearly 24%. ""The increase in the Pending Home Sales Index confirms that the US housing market has improved, or better put, has somewhat stabilized over the last several months due to lower mortgage interest rates,"" Raymond James chief economist Eugenio Aleman wrote in statement to Yahoo Finance. ""However, the recent increase in mortgage rates is probably going to inflict some more pain on the US housing market going forward."" Stocks closed out their worst week of 2023 on Friday after the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge showed it unexpectedly accelerated in January and consumer spending jumped. The “core” Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index – which excludes volatile food and energy components – showed prices climbed 0.6% in January and 4.7% from last year. The Commerce Department also reported consumer spending rose 1.8% last month from December, the largest increase in nearly two years. The survey’s results renewed anxiety among investors that the Fed would continue its aggressive tightening campaign against inflation. The drop in optimism pressured the major indexes, as the Dow Jones dropped 3% for its fourth consecutive losing week, while the S&P 500 shed 2.7% in its worst week since early December and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.3%. Data compiled by 22V Research has found that rising interest rates have increased the correlation between growth and value stocks to the highest level since at least 2005. This week, investors will remain keen on the retail sector, with earnings from Target (TGT) on deck before market open on Tuesday after Walmart (WMT) warned of cautious profit guidance for the year ahead. Home improvement retail giant Home Depot (HD) also had disappointing guidance for fiscal 2023. Elsewhere on the earnings calendar are results from Costco (COST), Macy's (M), Dollar Tree (DLTR), and Kohl's (KSS) to feature the retail side. Meanwhile, the share of companies topping analysts' expectations in the fourth quarter has been low compared to history. Data from FactSet showed that 68% of S&P 500 companies reported fourth quarter earnings that beat expectations, down from the five-year average of 77% and the 10-year average of 73%. In single stock moves, Seagen Inc. (SGEN) shares jumped Monday morning after a report from The Wall Street Journal said Pfizer (PFE) is in early-stage talks to acquire the cancer drugmaker company in what could be a multi-billion dollar deal. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK-B) stock rose following CEO Warren Buffett’s annual letter to shareholders, which offered readers a glimpse into his views on share buybacks, taxes, corporate accounting, and his sense of optimism about the economy. Shares of fuboTV (FUBO) sank after the sports-focused streaming service issued disappointing guidance in its fourth-quarter earnings report on Monday and disclosed that it had sold stock at a deeply discounted price. Fisker (FSR) shares jumped Monday after the electric vehicle startup announced its deliveries for its first vehicle, the Ocean SUV, would be completed by spring. Shares of Union Pacific (UNP) climbed after the largest freight operator announced its plans to name a new chief executive following pressure from activists to oust Lance Fritz from the job. Bath & Body Works (BBWI) shares fell after the company said in a letter to shareholders that the looming proxy battle is based on ""misguided"" motivations and would be detrimental to shareholders. The board made the decision to not appoint former Third Point co-chief investment officer Munib Islam. Elsewhere, in cryptocurrency news, Coinbase (COIN) said in a tweet that it will soon suspend trading for Binance's stablecoin, Binance USD, on March 13 at or around noon ET. The move comes after Paxos Trust disclosed it will stop creating the Binance-branded stablecoin, citing regulatory pressure. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Growth is slowing. Analysts are worried fundamentals will get worse before they get better as companies curtail tech spending amid a sluggish global economy. A fresh round of layoffs at Salesforce have just been uncorked....at a company that has only known aggressive hiring. Employees are questioning leadership at the tech titan. Co-CEO Bret Taylor is no longer co-CEO of Salesforce — instead he's off to launch an AI startup the serial entrepreneur tells me. Slack founder Stewart Butterfield, who stayed on when the company was acquired by Salesforce, is still founder...but no longer with the parent company. Salesforce co-founder Marc Benioff is back at the CEO helm, after attempting again to pullback from day to day duties (by delegating to a co-CEO) and focus more on his vast philanthropic ventures. To top it all off the company is staring down the barrel of five sharks in the field of activist money management: Elliott Management, Starboard Value, Inclusive Capital, ValueAct, and Third Point. This is an unprecedented activist versus public company battle, pros have told Yahoo Finance. How it ends is wildly unclear, but is a situation just as important as Wednesday's earnings report. ""While the involvement of five activist investors has likely been the primary driver of CRM stock of late, quarterly results probably still matter (though not as much as usual), and how those results are delivered may be more relevant than ever,"" said Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci. Below, Yahoo Finance breaks down this complicated situation at large-cap tech name Salesforce. The drama is high, and it could all be coming down to one final epic conclusion. What Yahoo Finance Is Watching: Salesforce Earnings What sources tell us is top of mind on the Street: How quickly are sales deteriorating inside of the broader tech pullback? What does the pipeline of future business look like? Does Marc Benioff acknowledge the activist situation? Are more layoffs needed? Consensus is that Salesforce warns on sales and earnings for 2023 – but how bad is it? The Vibe Among Wall Street Analysts Analysts are generally expecting a muted tone from Salesforce on earnings day. “For Benioff and Salesforce the actual quarter and FY24 take a back seat to the fluid activist situation which is happening at Salesforce with the Street's patience wearing thin after a head scratcher Slack deal and slowing growth/underachieving margins front and center.” -Wedbush analyst Dan Ives ""Key to the Q4 call is gaining clarity on the extent to which management will turn the dial up on non-GAAP operating margins, GAAP profitability, and any future share repurchases with the emergence of activist involvement in the stock."" -Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss What the Activists Want From Salesforce Sources tell Yahoo Finance that Starboard Value — led by veteran activist investor and Papa John's chairman Jeff Smith — has been disappointed in Salesforce’s expense management, but isn’t advocating for a sale of Slack. Other activists involved in the situation are keen to see a Slack sale even at a low price as a show of faith by management they will improve margins, sources say. Overall, we are told the activists are entrenched and want clear changes from Salesforce leadership. Key thing the activist pool wants: Higher profit margins Realistic 2023 guidance Clear succession plan from CEO co-founder Marc Benioff Like we said, this earnings report is a defining moment in the history of Salesforce.

2023-02-26,amzn,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stocks-under-pressure-retail-earnings-continue-what-to-know-this-week-142308388.html,"The 2023 stock market rally is under pressure. Inflation data last week that topped expectations — as well as a continued drop in optimism the Federal Reserve's rate hikes will end sooner rather than later — pressured the major indexes with the Dow logging a fourth-straight losing week and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq suffering their worst weeks of the year, losing 2.7% and 3.4%, respectively. The Dow endured its worst weekly performance since Sept. 2022. In the week ahead, investors will remain keyed in on the retail sector, with results from Target (TGT) in focus after rival Walmart (WMT) issued a warning on the state of U.S. consumers last week. On the economic data side, a crowded calendar of reports from the housing and manufacturing sectors — two areas of the economy which have most reflected the impact of policy tightening — is on tap along with a key measure of consumer confidence. On Friday, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index — the Fed's preferred assessment of how quickly prices are rising across the economy — showed prices rose 0.6% during the month of January and 5.4% over last year. On a ""core"" basis, which strips out volatile food and energy components, prices rose 0.6% for the month and at an annual clip of 4.7%. The week marked a turning point in sentiment around inflation expectations and the path forward for interest rates. The hotter-than-expected PCE index followed upside surprises to inflation this year from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and producer prices, which showed the largest increases in several months to start the year. ""The bear market rally that began in October from reasonable prices and low expectations has morphed into a speculative frenzy based on a Fed pause/pivot that isn't coming,"" Morgan Stanley's top strategist Mike Wilson said in a note to clients last week. Wilson's forecast sees the S&P 500 bottoming out at 3,000 this year. On Friday, the benchmark U.S. equity index closed at 3,970. ""Investor optimism had already been hit by a slow puncture this week but it's deflating more rapidly as the latest data indicates that the work in taming inflation is far from over,"" Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in a note. Standout economic data releases in the week ahead include the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index, ISM's manufacturing PMI, and The Conference Board's consumer confidence reading for February. On the corporate side, Target will release its fourth-quarter earnings results before market open on Tuesday with results from Costco (COST), Macy's (M), Dollar Tree (DLTR), and Kohl's (KSS) also featuring on the retail side. Last week, Walmart's CFO John David Rainey said the ""consumer is still very pressured, and if you look at economic indicators, balance sheets are running thinner and savings rates are declining relative to previous periods."" ""We expect Target's results will look similar to Walmart's, with better-than-expected sales, more gross margin pressure than predicted, and solid opex leverage in the store,"" Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe said in a note. Tarlowe warned, however, Target is not ""immune to consumer spending trends shifting to the more needs-based items and away from higher-priced and higher-margin discretionary categories."" Elsewhere on the earnings calendar, notable reports include Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Zoom Video (ZM), AMC Entertainment (AMC), Rivian Automotive (RIVN), and Dell (DELL) among others. — Monday: Durable Goods Orders, January Preliminary (-3.8% expected, 5.6% during prior month); Durables Excluding Transportation, January Preliminary (0.1% expected, -0.2% during prior month); Non-defense Capital Goods Orders Excluding Aircraft, January Preliminary (0.0% expected, -0.1% during prior month); Non-defense Capital Goods Shipments Excluding Aircraft, January Preliminary (-0.6% during prior month); Pending Home Sales, month-over-month, January (1.0% expected, 2.5% during prior month); Pending Home Sales NSA, year-over-year, January (-34.3% during prior month); Dallas Fed Manufacturing Activity, February (-9.10 expected, -8.4 during prior month) Tuesday: Advance Goods Trade Balance, January (-$91.0 billion expected, -$90.3 billion during prior month, revised to -$89.7 billion); Wholesale Inventories, month-over-month, January Preliminary (0.1% expected, 0.1% during previous month); Retail Inventories, month-over-month, January (0.5% during prior month); House Price Purchase Index, quarter-over-quarter, Q4 (0.1% during prior quarter); FHFA Housing Pricing Index, December (-0.1% during prior month); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City Composite, month-over-month, December (-0.54% during prior month); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City Composite, year-over-year, December (6.77% during prior month); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, year-over-year, December (7.69% during prior month); MNI Chicago PMI, February (44.3 during prior month); Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index, February (-11 during prior month); Conference Board Consumer Confidence, February (108.5 expected, 107.1 during prior month); Richmond Fed Business Conditions, February (-10 during prior month); Dallas Fed Services Activity, February (-15.0 during prior month) Wednesday: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Feb. 24 (-13.3% during prior week); S&P Global U.S. Manufacturing PMI, February Final (47.8 prior); Construction Spending, month-over-month, January (0.4% expected, -0.4% during prior month); ISM Manufacturing, February (47.9 expected, 47.4 during prior month); ISM Prices Paid, February (44.5 during prior month); ISM Employment, February (50.6 during prior month); ISM New Orders, February (42.5 during prior month); Wards Total Vehicle Sales, February (15.00 million, 15.74 million during prior month) Thursday: Unit Labor Costs, Q4 Final (2.5% expected, 3.0% during prior quarter); Nonfarm Productivity, Q4 Final (1.5% expected, 1.1% during prior quarter); Initial Jobless Claims, week ended Feb. 24 (TK expected, 192,000 during prior week); Continuing Claims, week ended Feb. 18 (1.654 million during prior week) Friday: S&P Global U.S. Services PMI, February Final (50.5 during prior month); S&P Global U.S. Services Composite PMI, February Final (50.2 during prior month); ISM Services Index, February (54.5 expected, 55.2 during prior month) — Monday: Groupon (GRPN), LendingTree (TREE), Li Auto (LI), Lordstown Motors (RIDE), Oak Street Health (OSH), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Workday (WDAY), Zoom Video (ZM) Tuesday: AMC Entertainment (AMC), AutoZone (AZO), Cracker Barrel (CBRL), Compass (COMP), Duolingo (DUOL), GoodRx (GDRX), HP (HP), J.M.

2023-02-24,amzn,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-today-february-24-2023-104349492.html,"U.S. stocks tumbled Friday after the Federal Reserve's most closely watched inflation measure came in stronger than expected, in another sign that price pressures have become sticky into 2023. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) sank 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) plopped more than 300 points, or 1%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid 1.7%. Friday marked the worst week for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq since December. U.S. Treasury yields scrambled higher following the reading. The 2-year note surged 12 basis points to 4.81% while the 10-year note gained 7 basis points to top 3.95%. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index — the Fed's preferred assessment of how quickly prices are rising across the economy — rose 0.6% in January and 5.4% from last year. On a ""core"" basis, which strips out volatile food and energy components, prices rose 0.6% for the month and 4.7% from last year. The report from the Commerce Department also showed that consumer spending rose 1.8% last month from December after falling the previous month. The numbers support recent indications inflation is not falling at the pace and extent investors have been hoping for, even as prices have stabilized from the peaks of the current inflation cycle. “First December CPI was revised higher, and now each reading for January surprised to the upside. Inflation’s like an old boyfriend or girlfriend that keeps showing up when you don’t want to see them,"" David Russell, Vice President of Market Intelligence at TradeStation said in a note. In individual stock moves, Block (SQ) rose 4.3% after the payments processor reported fourth-quarter financial results that saw profit and revenue top expectations. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) shares fell 1% after the media giant posted a big revenue loss for the final three months of the year. Boeing (BA) shares closed down 4.8% after the airline manufacturer said it paused deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner jets because of a documentation issue. Beyond Meat's (BYND) stock rallied 10% after better-than-expected earnings and CEO Ethan Brown said the company is seeing progress in its efforts to cut costs and manufacturing hurdles. Beleaguered used car retailer (CVNA) plunged 20.5% after reporting a net loss that was nine times wider in the fourth quarter. The bumpier-than-anticipated road to restoring price stability and strong economic data to start the year — nonfarm payrolls rose by 517,000 in January while retail sales surged 3% — have prompted investors to readjust expectations around the path forward for interest rates, putting a dent in the market's recent momentum. The S&P 500 snapped a four-day losing streak on Thursday as stocks closed higher. But earlier this week on Tuesday, stocks had their worst day of the year. ""Equity bulls and even Chair Powell have bragged about anchored expectations for inflation and how consumers and investors believe it is moving in the right direction,"" Morgan Stanley Chief Investment Officer Lisa Shalett said in a note earlier this week, noting that January's Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) raised questions about whether inflation progress is stalling. ""Given data crosscurrents, the central bank needs to tread carefully. Investors still wagering on a 'Fed put; or quick return to financial repression are apt to be wrong this time,"" Shalett said. ""Fed credibility is on the line, and it is likely to risk overshooting rather than quitting the inflation fight too early."" — Alexandra Semenova is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-02-24,amzn,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/fed-inflation-fight-longer-pce-index-173353572.html,"Two Federal Reserve officials suggested Friday morning that inflation could persist longer than thought after the central bank's most closely watched inflation gauge surged by the most in months. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Fed Governor Philip Jefferson said they remain concerned about an inflation rate that remains well above the Fed's 2% year-over-year target. Mester reiterated that while inflation has moderated, the overall level remains too high. She noted recent research from the Cleveland Fed and a discussion paper that have suggested inflation could be more persistent than currently anticipated. “I see the risks to the inflation forecast as tilted to the upside and the costs of continued high inflation as being significant,” Mester said at the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum in New York. “So in my view, at this point, with the labor market still strong, the costs of undershooting on policy or prematurely loosening policy still outweigh the costs of overshooting.” The comments came as the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation – the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index – unexpectedly accelerated in January, rising 5.4% last month on an annual basis. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the inflation gage rose 4.7%, both marking pickups after several months of declines. On a monthly basis, the PCE index rose 0.6% in January compared with December. Core prices also rose 0.6% in January from the prior month, compared with December’s 0.4% increase. The numbers Friday came a week after the government released the Consumer Price Index, which showed a similar pickup in the inflation rate. The hot read on inflation hit markets on renewed rate hike fears, with the Dow Jones Industrial average tanking 336 points. ""By betting on a terminal rate above 5.35%, the market is effectively betting that the recent momentum in both growth and inflation will be sustained through the summer,"" Jefferies chief economist Aneta Markowska said. Mester, who does not vote on monetary policy decisions this year, told Bloomberg in an interview Friday morning that the latest inflation reading shows the Fed needs to keep raising interest rates but stopped short of suggesting it required a 50-basis-point rate hike at the next policy meeting in March. Mester said last week she wanted to raise the benchmark policy rate by 50 basis points at the last policy meeting to try to get to the peak rate faster, though she also didn't want to surprise markets. In a separate interview Friday morning with CNBC, Mester signaled her forecast in December to raise rates a bit above 5% hasn’t changed much. Speaking at the same Monetary Policy Forum on Friday, Boston Fed President Susan Collins said inflation is still too high and that the Fed has more work to do. “Inflation remains too high, and recent data …all reinforce my view that we have more work to do, to bring inflation down to the 2 percent target,” said Collins. “I anticipate further rate increases to reach a sufficiently restrictive level, then holding there for some, perhaps extended, time.” Also speaking at the conference, Jefferson said a limited supply of workers for jobs needed, which has pushed up wages, suggests inflation may cool slowly. “The ongoing imbalance between the supply and demand for labor, combined with the large share of labor costs in the services sector, suggests that high inflation may come down only slowly,” he said. Jefferson also said the forces driving inflation now are different that past inflationary episodes and therefore economic models won’t be as helpful to policymakers. Jefferson said the current situation is different because the pandemic created unprecedented disruptions to global supply chains and is having a long-lasting impact on the labor participation rate. “The inflationary forces impinging on the U.S. economy at present represent a complex mixture of temporary and more long-lasting elements that defy simple, parsimonious explanation,” he said. Jefferson says he thinks the Fed is addressing the spike in inflation proactively, unlike in the 1970s and has more credibility now.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. What's old may be new again for U.S. stock investors. The end of zero-interest rate policies (ZIRP) is likely to mark a shift in equity market favorites from long-leading technology names to sectors like energy, materials and housing — or what strategists at Bank of America deem part of ""the old economy."" ""Bear markets have historically resulted in leadership change, which suggests old economy sectors are likely the winners of this cycle,"" Savita Subramanian, BofA’s head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy said in a note earlier this week. With these components of the market depleted of capital over the past ten years as Big Tech was powered by free money, the ""pendulum is expected to swing back"" in their direction, Subramanian noted. Despite the big gains across January in these very stocks that were battered throughout 2022, investors have called the moves higher this year a bear market rally rather than the start of a new bull market. ""I think the stock market is in a protracted bear market,"" DoubleLine Capital founder and CEO Jeffrey Gundlach told Yahoo Finance Live in an interview Wednesday (video above), adding it began in the fourth quarter of 2021. ""[It's] very negative for the stock market when you have rising interest rates against these valuations, especially real interest rates,"" Gundlach said, adding a pause in the increase in real rates this fall was a catalyst for the recovery in risk assets. ""But it looks like real interest rates might start rising again."" Meanwhile on Sunday, Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson told clients in a not that the recent rally was ""a speculative frenzy"" based on false hopes for a pivot by the Federal Reserve. Equity markets are in the throes of a recent shift in the narrative for where interest rates will go, finally taking Fed officials at face value as they vow to lift their policy rate above 5% this year. Bank of America indicated its analysis of equity risk premium shows growth stocks were not pricing in recession risk and the expected higher-for-longer rate environment is projected to pressure long-duration growth stocks. Whatever the rest of the year holds for the U.S. stock market, signs have already emerged of an imminent change in leadership. Last year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average crushed the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite, for example, falling less than 10% in 2022 while the latter index wiped out more than one third of its value. As Yahoo Finance’s Jared Blikre pointed out, the Dow’s outperformance relative to the tech index was by far the biggest gap since the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. Goldman Sachs’s chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin warned in November that the ""exceptionalism of technology is arguably behind us. In 2022, the aggregate market capitalization of the current ""tetrad of largest stocks,"" as Goldman Sachs put it — Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) – fell to 18% from 22% the prior year. And those top four stocks lost an aggregate -25% compared to -13% for the remaining stocks in the index during the period. ""With the end of ZIRP, we see the pendulum swinging back to the old economy as prolonged underinvestment has led to supply issues in the old economy,"" Subramanian said. Bank of America itself raised metals to overweight, and is overweight energy, a testament to its confidence in the leadership transition.

2023-03-10,amzn,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/walmart-starts-making-inroads-amazons-154152727.html,"Walmart Inc’s (NYSE: WMT) online subscription service Walmart+ met success with inflation-sensitive higher-income households as the retailer prioritizes the segment in a tectonic change to its reputation as a destination for lower- and middle-income shoppers. Walmart sees e-commerce as a big selling point, Bloomberg reports. At $98 a year, Walmart+ is cheaper by $41 than Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime with similar perks, like shipping discounts and video streaming. Walmart’s subscription service also includes benefits, including discounted fuel at gas stations around the U.S. In February, 28% of U.S. households with an annual income of at least $150,000 were members of Walmart+, up from 13% a year earlier, according to Prosper Insights & Analytics. Still, Amazon Prime has a commanding lead with 77% of those households, up 700 bps from the previous year. As Walmart attracts more shoppers, it draws more brands, multiplying the number of shoppers, benefiting from the same “flywheel” effect Amazon experienced when it launched Prime in 2005. Besides borrowing Amazon’s online playbook, Walmart is capitalizing on a network of stores within 10 miles of 90% of Americans. America’s largest grocer also has a lead in fresh food, a market Amazon has been trying to decrypt for years. Walmart+ offers members free delivery on orders of at least $35. In February, Amazon raised its free grocery delivery threshold to orders of at least $150. “Walmart is eating into Amazon’s e-commerce market share and legitimately becoming a competitor,” said Alasdair McLean-Foreman, founder and CEO of Teikametrics, which helps merchants buy advertising on Amazon, Walmart. According to Insider Intelligence, Walmart will likely have 6.3% of the U.S. online market this year, a fraction of Amazon’s estimated 37.6% share. Walmart.com is also less crowded than Amazon.com, with about 135,000 merchants compared with some 2 million on Amazon. He said that makes it easier for brands to stand out on Walmart. About 65% of Walmart+ members are between 18 and 44 years old, versus 51% for Amazon Prime, according to Prosper, a promising trend for Walmart. Walmart+ has plenty of room to grow. According to a Morgan Stanley February survey, about 11 million U.S. shoppers are “very likely” to subscribe to the service, adding to the approximately 18.5 million existing members. Meanwhile, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, Amazon Prime had 168 million members in the U.S. as of December, unchanged from a year earlier. Price Action: WMT shares traded higher by 0.57% at $137.94 premarket on the last check Friday. Photo via Wikimedia Commons Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

As such, it isn't possible to know stocks that will generate strong returns for sure. Nevertheless, there are leading companies that benefit from secular growth trends that could potentially generate substantial profits in the future. Leading companies have a lot of scale and competitive advantages. Some leading companies are tech giants that benefit from the increasing popularity of AI. Companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) own leading cloud infrastructure businesses that will likely realize more demand from AI processing as AI apps grow. Some leading companies benefit from increases in the broader market, which could increase demand for asset management services such as BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) and Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS). Some leading companies such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) could benefit from the metaverse trend if it achieves the potential that some bulls think it can in the future.

In the near term, things are uncertain as the economy is currently strong but inflation is higher than the U.S. central bank would like. As a result, the Federal Reserve will likely continue to raise interest rates further and this could slow economic growth. If economic growth slows too much, demand for many companies might weaken more than expected and the job market might weaken. On March 9, the S&P 500 fell 1.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined by 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite retreated 2% due to a steep drop in SVB Financial which pressured banking stocks and also the weekly report on initial filings for unemployment insurance showing 211,000 claims were filed last week, up 21,000 from the previous week. Given the near term uncertainty and considering one company might not do well in the long term for any number of reasons, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.

With that, I will turn the call over to Yaniv. Yaniv Zion Sarig Thank you, Ilya, and thanks everyone on the call. Today, I'm going to go over the following topics. I'll start with a quick introduction of Aterian, for those who are new to our story, I'll then review key takeaways from our fourth quarter of last year, and I'll discuss our goals for 2023. Lastly, I'll address the long-term prospects for Aterian and share why we believe in our vision for the consumer product platform in the future. For those who are new to the story, here's what you need to know about our company. Aterian is part of a new breed of technology-enabled consumer product companies. We focus on building, acquiring and partnering with e-commerce brands online. Aterian owns and operates several consumer brands selling products across various categories on channels such as Amazon, Walmart, Shopify and eBay, both domestically and internationally. To allow us to scale, we've invested in building our own proprietary platform called AIMEE. AIMEE enables our team to manage our business more efficiently by injecting technology into processes that would otherwise have to be executed manually and will require hiring an unscalable and unsustainable workforce. Through its ability to analyze vast amounts of data and automate daily recurring tasks, AIMEE allows our team to find new product opportunities we can launch under our brands, manage these products at scale effectively across various channels, automate certain marketing and fulfillment task and much more. Our goal in the long term is to become one of the most efficient consumer companies in the world, expanding our footprint globally while continuing to invest in technology and an agile supply chain to drive scale and profitability. I'll now take a few moments to speak about our Q4 results as well as our goals for 2023. As we shared previously, our goal was, first and foremost, a discount and sell through high-cost inventory. As a reminder, due to the shipping container cost skyrocketing in 2021 and 2022, consumer brands across our industry were forced to ship goods at an average cost of [$17,000] per container to stay in business. These additional costs forced us to increase our product prices by an average of 20%, only to generate an average of 8% contribution margin, with some of our products seeing as low as 6% contribution margin versus our target of 15% at a normal price. As we saw the cost of shipping finally coming down, we took advantage of Q4 of last year and the demand that was generated by the holidays, discount our inventory to cycle through our existing goods so that we can replenish inventory at a lower cost basis, benefiting from pre-pandemic rates of shipping. What we're seeing now is an average cost of container that's closer to $4,000 per container. While our adjusted EBITDA took a hit, the decision to liquidate the long inventory now puts us on track to get back to stronger contribution margin starting in Q1 and Q2 of this year, and leading to our guidance of turning adjusted EBITDA profitable in the second half of 2023. This decision was also critical to preserve the competitive advantage of our product and avoid getting undercut by competitors who would benefit from the lower shipping rates. It's important to understand that our discounting and inventory liquidation efforts do not reflect a weak portfolio. In fact, some of our best products were part of the strategic efforts, all to make room for inventory at a lower cost basis. I'm happy to report our overall inventory position has been reduced from $76 million back when we started our normalization efforts in June of last year to $43 million in Q4. And the risky inventory has improved by $3 million, and we expect additional normalization to happen in Q1 with another $3 million to $4 million of inventory cycle through. This cash generation improves our balance sheet heading into '23. Our entire team feels now that Aterian has surmounted a very difficult period. And putting aside remaining inventory normalization we need to accomplish in Q1, we can finally look to pursue growth and profitability again. The energy and motivation we have comes from the relief and satisfaction of navigating complex challenges, but also from a continued belief in our vision. So what does the road ahead look like? I want to outline some of our goals in the next few months and explain how they tie into our vision. First and foremost, in line with the Q4 efforts, we're laser focused on achieving adjusted EBITDA profitability in the second half of the -- for our core business. This effort is primarily based on getting our cost basis of products back to pre early pandemic levels and executing well on our marketing strategies. Separately, many of our competitors have not been able to navigate out of the difficult macro level environment, and we're in the process of assessing several significant M&A opportunities to acquire assets from other Amazon aggregators. This is an ongoing effort and while we cannot guarantee its results, we're very optimistic about our ability to bolt on substantial amounts of additional contribution margin that will accelerate churning full year profitable in 2024. We're also finally going back to launch new products. And while we have already over 20 new products being developed, we're also looking to take our model a step further by starting to develop more differentiated and unique products. While we don't expect to become a hardware company by any means, we believe that the insights from our data-driven approach can provide the opportunity to work closely with manufacturers to design more advanced differentiated features through a bootstrap approach. We're also very much focused on continuing our international expansion. Recently, we made great progress with our European expansion, and our goal is to be as optimally positioned with our existing portfolio in Europe in 2024. Finally, I want to speak briefly about the long-term prospects for Aterian. We launched this company back in 2014 because we believe that e-commerce adoption will grow steadily year-on-year and marketplaces will dominate the lion's share of GMV globally. We were accurate about that prediction and a focus on building a company that can manage and scale brands and products with a marketplace for [doctrine]. According to research by [Essential], third-party sales through online marketplaces will account for 59% of all global commerce by 2027. We also realized at an inception that marketplaces will allow retailers to delegate a lot of their work to the brand, using -- to the brands that use them, which makes it difficult for those brands to scale. Just to look at the composition of sellers on Amazon tells a pretty remarkable story. While Amazon is not publishing this figure, Industry estimates are that third-party sellers on its marketplace generate approximately $390 billion of GMV. Of the 1 million plus active sellers out there, industry estimates point to massive fragmentation, only 60,000 sellers passing the $1 million a year revenue threshold in approximately 50 businesses only crossing the $100 million mark. So marketplaces of the future and have removed the barriers of entry that exist in traditional brick-and-mortar retail, allowing almost anyone to sell their products to hundreds of millions of buyers, but this comes at a price. Brands must manage all aspects of the business themselves. This includes forecasting, managing inventory, managing prices and discounts, managing marketing. This is where technology comes in. We always believe since inception, that the only way to scale a consumer company on marketplaces was to inject technology into its operations to automate the daily task required. Today, we use machine learning to help us reduce the cost of forecasting media buying and pricing optimization, recent exciting developments in AI should be eye-opening for any business leader out there. Aterian is already leveraging large language models such as ChatGPT to help synthesize sentiment in reviews, and we're looking to extend our use of AI rapidly to further improve our efficiency. Aterian is a consumer product company, not an AI company, but all consumer product companies out there, I believe -- from all companies out there, I believe that we have the DNA, the expertise and the culture to leverage technology to achieve a market-leading position in our industry over the long term. In general, I believe that the world will rapidly see 2 types of businesses forming. Those have built the internal expertise to harness AI as a powerful force that drives efficiency and competitive edge, and those who will be remembered in history books as not agile enough to adapt. Aterian does not only wish to be part of the first group. It's already one of the most sophisticated companies when it comes to applying technology to drive the value chain of e-commerce consumer brands. With that, I'll pass it on to Arty. Arturo Rodriguez Thanks, Yaniv, and good day, everyone. Here are the financial performance details of our fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of '22, net revenue declined 13.3% to $54.9 million from $63.3 million in the year ago quarter, primarily due to reduced consumer demand, offset by a strategy of liquidating high-cost inventory. The fourth quarter net revenue of $54.9 million is comprised primarily of $52.3 million of our organic business, a nominal amount of revenue from our most recent acquisition and $2.6 million of wholesale revenue. The year ago quarter net revenue of $63.3 million was comprised primarily of $31.3 million of our organic business, $27.6 million of net revenue from our acquisitions and $4.4 million of wholesale revenue. Our organic revenue increased by $21 million due to classification of our past acquisition revenue going into organic revenue, our strategy to sell off higher-priced inventory and normalized inventory levels, offset by reduced consumer demand in the period. Our M&A revenue decreased approximately $27 million as all our material acquisitions have now been known for over a year, and that revenue has shifted into the organic revenue categorization. Our Q4 acquisition, while nominal from a financial perspective, was strategic and designed to leverage a competitor and drive sales to one of our other leading brand, and we are pleased with the progress of this strategy to date. Looking at our fourth quarter net revenue by phase, the $54.9 million broke down as follows: $40.8 million in sustain, $0.1 million in launch and $13 million in liquidate and inventory normalization. The year ago quarter net revenues of $63.3 million by phase broke down as follows: $52.7 million in sustain, $2.6 million in launch and $8 million in liquidate and inventory normalization. Our sustain decrease of $12 million relates to revenue shifting into liquidation phase and general consumer softness. Our liquidation increased by $5 million from our strategic initiative to sell off higher price inventory and normalized inventory levels. Finally, on revenue, our launch revenue declined as we previously disclosed, are pausing of launching new products in '22. The current launch revenues primarily attributed new valuations of existing products in the quarter. We are currently planning new product introductions for '23, though the timing will be opportunistic. Overall gross margin for the fourth quarter declined to 37.1% from 45.6% in the year ago quarter and decreased from 45.5% in Q3 '22, primarily attributed to our strategic initiative to sell off higher-priced inventory normalized inventory levels. Our overall Q4 '22 contribution margin, as defined in our earnings release, was negative 11.5% which decreased compared to the prior year CM of 7.9%, which is directly attributed to higher liquidation revenue from our strategic initiative to sell off higher priced inventory to normalized inventory level. Our Q4 2022 saw our sustain product contribution margin decreased to 8.3% versus 16.1% in Q4 '21 as we also reduced pricing to normalized inventory levels and other listing management initiatives. We do expect our sustained contribution margin to improve as we progress in 2023. Looking deeper into contribution margin for Q4 '22, our variable sales and distribution expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased to 51.6% as compared to 40.1% in the year ago quarter. This increase was primarily due to higher cost supply chain, including last-mile fulfillment and our product mix, including liquidation and normalization of inventory, offset by reduced storage costs. We do expect our sales and distribution expenses as a percentage of net revenue to improve as we progress in 2023. Our operating loss for the quarter of $22.8 million includes a reserve for barter credits of $1.6 million, $2.7 million of noncash stock compensation and a noncash loss on goodwill of $0.5 million. Our net loss for the quarter of $20.3 million includes a reserve for barter credits of $1.6 million, $2.7 million in noncash stock compensation, a noncash loss of goodwill of $0.5 million and a gain on fair value of warrant liability of $2.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our earnings release, for the fourth quarter of 2022 was a loss of $16.2 million compared to a loss of $3 million in the fourth quarter of '21. Our strategic decision of liquidating higher cost inventory and normalizing our inventory levels impacted our adjusted EBITDA in the period. However, this was a very important effort leading us to improve our core business and putting us on track to get back to stronger contribution margins in '23 and strengthening our balance sheet as we headed into the new year. Turning to the balance sheet. At December 31, we had cash of approximately $43.6 million compared with $26 million at the end of September 30. The increase in cash is primarily driven by the previously reported $20 million capital raised in early October, positive changes in working capital, offset by our net losses in the period. Our working capital improvement was part of our goal to strengthen the balance sheet, driven by moving out our more expensive long inventory and at December 31 inventory landed at $43.3 million, we have made great strides in Q3 and Q4 of improving our inventory composition and reducing our overall inventory as we expect to be completed with this process by mid-Q2 '23. Our credit facility balance landed at $21 million, which is down almost $3 million from the sequential quarter and down almost $12 million from December 31, '21. As our cash position has improved from capital raise and as we continue to normalize inventory, this reduced balance also resulted in lower interest expense. As we look at Q1 '23, which is typically our lowest revenue quarter and taking into account the current global environment inflation, we believe net revenue will be between $32 million and $36 million. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance is beginning to show improvement as we progress towards adjusted EBITDA profitability in the second half of '23. For the first quarter of '23, we expect adjusted EBITDA loss to be in the range of $4.8 million to $5.8 million, anticipating continued impact of inventory liquidation. This Q1 '23 adjusted EBITDA guidance on average is a 70% improvement from our Q4 '22 reported adjusted EBITDA and on average of 40% improvement from Q3 '22 adjusted EBITDA as we are beginning to see the results of our strategic efforts of liquidating high-cost inventory and normalizing our inventory level. In closing, '22 was a challenging year, but we have persevered through global supply chain disruptions and a challenging macroeconomic conditions. We have significantly reduced our inventory by moving on high-cost inventory and normalizing our inventory levels, which we believe puts us in a position to be adjusted EBITDA profitable in the second half of '23. We have also strengthened our balance sheet in '22, which gives us flexibility to navigate the current macroeconomic environment as it continues to unfold and allowing us to be laser focused on driving our core business. We are excited and proud of the company we are building. Aterian continues to have a very strong brand and many of our products continue to be some of the best sellers on Amazon. We continue to have industry-leading technology and logistics, and most importantly, our dedicated and hard-working people continue to do extraordinary work. As such, we are very confident and optimistic about Aterian's future. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator to open the call up to questions. Operator (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Alex Fuhrman with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Alex Joseph Fuhrman Congratulations on what looks like a strong success, clearing some of the inventory that you'd been hoping to. I was wondering if you could talk about which categories you've seen the most demand for both during Q4 and now that we've got a couple of months of 2023 under your belt, where you're seeing the most demand? And is that informing where you're looking for M&A? Or are you really looking at all different categories for that? Yaniv Zion Sarig Alex, Yaniv here. I'll take that question. Good question. Overall, as we mentioned, overall consumer demand is a little softer, right? But because of all the efforts we've done on liquidation, we've got more success across pretty much the Board when it comes to the categories as typical with the seasonality of Q4 versus Q1, Q2 Q3, not a big difference there. I think I'd say to the second part of your question, the -- where we're looking for when it comes to acquisitions, I said in general, we probably want to diversify our portfolio a little bit. If possible, right, M&A is more opportunistic, but as much as possible from, I think, the supply chains that have hurt us in the last few years. So we're definitely tending to set our eyes a little more towards consumer product companies that are making their goods not necessarily in Asia, but maybe in the U.S. or Eastern Europe, South America. But of course, we're looking and leaving our eyes open to any of the opportunities. But again, if possible, we would -- the main goal potentially with the future M&A would be as much as possible, diversify from a supply chain perspective. Alex Joseph Fuhrman Okay. That's really helpful. And then can you give us a little bit more color on the bridge of how you get from what you just reported and what you're guiding to in Q1 to being adjusted EBITDA positive in the second half of the year. It looks like what you're guiding to for profitability in Q1 is better than -- I was expecting at least a much smaller than expected loss. How do you walk us from that in Q1 to being positive in the second half of the year? Is it primarily gross margin as you start to sell through inventory that wasn't brought in at insane container rates? Yaniv Zion Sarig Yes. I'll let Arty add. Go ahead, Arty. Arturo Rodriguez Yes. Thanks, Yaniv. No, Alex, I think you nailed it right at the end. I think -- as we said previously, it's taking us a couple of quarters here to get rid of this really expensive inventory that we brought in strategically back pre late 2021, but we had to take the impact, unfortunately, and pay those container rates. As you move that through, you're going to get back to a place where you can get back to target type CMs, right? And with that, you should drive into profitability. Obviously, consumer spend is always a question mark, but we do feel very confident that I think once we move through this more expensive inventory and the inventory that we're bringing in that's starting to land in April and May. For Q3 and even parts of our Q2 seasonal sales will be at better margins. And that's why we can sort of feel pretty confident in what we're seeing. Operator Our next question will come from Brian Kinstlinger with Alliance Global Partners. Brian David Kinstlinger Sorry, I joined late, if you answered this in your prepared remarks, but with the company releasing new SKUs now, maybe you can update us on how many SKUs were released in the fourth quarter, maybe how many you're expecting in the first quarter and maybe for the full year rough numbers. You don't have the exact number, but -- and then how is the weak consumer spending environment changing the pace of SKU launches? Yaniv Zion Sarig Brian, just to clarify, we're starting to launch products, but as you know, we're at -- that process takes time. And so my comment was on the fact that we have over 20 products that have been worked on and will be launched some of it this year, some of it next year. I think the impact you'll see is that through this year, we will continue to develop and launch products and most of it will come in 2024. So as you remember, right, the main reason we paused launching products was because of the unreliability of supply chains, both in terms of good arriving on time with all the delays that we've seen in the past but also very importantly, right, the fluctuations in cost of shipping were so unpredictable that it just creates a situation where you plan to launch a product and by the time it arrives, your cost basis is higher than you expected, and that's just not leading towards a good launch, right? So we essentially paused that for quite a while now. And now that we're finally seeing that stability in the supply chain, both in terms of the price of shipping but also the reliability, we're getting confident to go back to get and launch these products. But most of that the impact of these products and the launches happening will happen again second half of this year and mostly the impact will be felt in 2024. Brian David Kinstlinger Okay. And so are there any in the first -- in the fourth quarter and expected in the first quarter? Or are they all in process right now? Yaniv Zion Sarig So if there were any in the fourth quarter, there would have been products that would be what we call variations which means we kind of like to think of them as another version of an existing product. That's where we would have felt more comfortable. I don't -- it's not as material as when we typically do the launches that you're thinking about. And so again, I think that the answer is that with the efforts that we're putting on now, we'll be able to do it at least in the next few months, give a little more clarity on the time line that we're seeing around those launches happening. Brian David Kinstlinger And then as I've read more so in the private market, I think some -- there's some undercapitalized fulfilled by Amazon companies that are struggling. Are you beginning to see any fire sales and how aggressive can you when do you expect to be this year in 2023 in M&A? Yaniv Zion Sarig Yes, it's a great question, and you're absolutely right there. There's a lot of companies out there that are struggling, going through a lot of the challenges we went through in the last 1.5 years, let's say, right? And again, some of them are really in a very difficult situation. So we're very active talking to a lot of these competitors, exploring different opportunities, spending a lot of time with this. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we can't guarantee any outcome, but with the amount of effort that we're putting out there and the things we're seeing, we were overall quite optimistic that we'll be able to find some opportunities with distressed assets that are actually quite good, right? I mean I think a lot of the things we're seeing, obviously, it goes through the spectrum, right? But there's a lot of really good assets out there that we're basically dealing with the same situation where the demand of COVID and on the other side, the pressure of supply chain caused the perfect storm that put these great assets in a challenging position. And so we're, as I mentioned, quite active talking to all these companies and looking for these opportunities. We're hoping to have an exciting thing to share with everyone, but it's still work in progress at this point. Brian David Kinstlinger Last question I've got is when you first went public, there was a very pronounced seasonality to your business. Help us understand today how we should think about seasonality for the year in the different quarters. Yaniv Zion Sarig Yes. So I think the big difference from when we first IPO-ed and today, right, was at the time, I think Q2 and Q3 were kind of like the 2 strongest quarters and Q1 and Q4 were quite like behind. I think given the profile of the acquisitions we've done and some changes to our portfolio, Q4 now is becoming a much stronger quarter, right, and I think has the potential in a more normalized environment to see us even doing better over time. Q1 still is the one lag behind, but it's really -- it's really, again, just the composition of the portfolio that we have. And so you're still in a position where Q2 and Q3 are the strongest Q4 right behind there, and then Q1 is still behind the 3 of them right when you compare it to back when we IPO-ed. Operator Our next question will come from Marvin Fong with BTIG. Marvin Milton Fong I guess my first question, just on the first quarter revenue outlook down maybe something like 20% year-over-year. Just wondering if you could help us understand, I mean, how much of that is the consumer demand softness that you alluded to? Or is any of it just that you're entering the quarter with a little bit less inventory than you were in the same quarter last year? I just wanted to understand that dynamic a little bit better. Yaniv Zion Sarig Yes. Maybe I'll start and see if Arty wants to add anything. But just in general, Marvin, one of the, I think, maybe benefits of how we run our business and the different brands that we have across different categories, is that as opposed to probably other companies who are maybe just active in one category, we have a little bit more wider visibility on demand. And the answer is, as you kind of mentioned yourself, right, is really mainly driven by consumer demand being soft, right? I think that's no surprise given the overall economic outlook around us. But again, what's really good that we're seeing so far when it comes to our businesses, we're always kind of looking at that demand in the context of the entire category, and we have good visibility to the fact that it's not that we're losing market share, but more of that just a soft demand across the board, right? Arty, I don't know if you want to add anything, but that's kind of like overall how we are looking at this. Arturo Rodriguez Yes. No, that's right, Yaniv. I think that's why we're seeing that. I still think we still feel very confident on the year. I think we pointed in the past about being overall kind of flattish on the revenue side. So I just think a little bit -- we're seeing some of the consumer demand softness early in the year and then it should pick up back to where we believe will be stronger Q3 and Q4 revenues for us. I think the other side of that Marvin is even at that lower amount, you could see the adjusted EBITDA guidance improvement, right? It's a good testament of how we've really focused on clearing out the inventory that really set us up for a good 2023. And I think that's the other part of it, even though the revenue is low, you sort of see already the improvement based on the guide of the adjusted EBITDA on the profitability of the quarter. Marvin Milton Fong Yes. I mean you guys kind of basically touched on my next question, which was sort of you're reiterating reaching EBITDA breakeven in the second half of the year, you guys feel good in the sense that the consumer remains weak or even gets a little bit weaker, that you've stress tested it and you still feel good that you can hit that even if the consumer is softer. Yaniv Zion Sarig Yes. I mean I think -- yes, I think you're right. First of all, the category -- the consumer softness across the board, right? But I think also our experience with some of the categories and the positioning that we have on those in Q2, Q3 is giving us a lot of comfort around that. But again, the most important point here is really the cost base of the product, right? The contribution margin expansion that we were expecting is due to the fact that the efforts that we put in Q4 to make room for that inventory at a lower cost basis is going to create that margin expansion. And our logistics team has done a great job of securing a very significant amount of the inventory we needed for the second half at a lower cost, which also gives us a lot of comfort around that, right? I guess there was a lot of challenges, again, as I mentioned in the last 1.5 years, right, not just about the price of shipping but also the ability to even get your goods on a ship. And so now we feel quite confident in our projections given the fact that we were able to secure a position on the ship at a lower cost, and then we made room for that inventory to replace the older inventory, right? All these things combined give us that comfort with our prediction. Marvin Milton Fong Got you. And I guess my last question, maybe a more fun topic is you mentioned leveraging ChatGPT and OpenAI and that sort of thing. And also curious, I think you guys had always employed some form of AI looking at reviews and helping guide your business decisions and product decisions. Could you just kind of expand on what capabilities you're achieving now or expect to achieve in the near future with these new large language models that maybe you weren't able to efficiently in the past? Yaniv Zion Sarig Yes. Absolutely. So we use machine learning and automation across many different aspects of our business. I think if you really want to bucket in the 2 kind of big areas. One is understanding the consumer, their sentiment, what they think about other products, they think about our products. And the other side of it is just managing the complex quantitative day-to-day effort of managing the products, right, which includes, for example, forecasting, which is where we have developed our own machine learning base forecast and things like media buying and pricing, they use automation as well, right? So when it comes to what you mentioned with ChatGPT and large language model, I mean, I think the excitement obviously for us is huge. And as I mentioned in my comments before, we already started looking at -- I mean, not looking, we are already using ChatGPT to, in a way, actually augment some of the efforts that we've had with our own code around sentiment analysis on reviews. But Marvin, the most important thing that I think a lot of people that are not necessarily in the weeds on AI don't realize is that, the hardest thing about AI is actually having good data. And when I say that, what I mean is a lot of organization, except -- especially in the consumer product industry that is not necessarily a fact driven, right, not necessarily designed or have the DNA or have the systems and infrastructure and access -- and their own data in a way set up for AI, right? And that's something that really gives us some advantage, right? Because we -- we're a consumer company, right, but we're a consumer company that uses all our technology and things like a technology company, we have put us in a position through the years of effort that we put that we are set up to use AI across the board in many different ways. And again, with the large language models, I think that we'll see in the next few years, a lot of disruption across many different functions of business but I think only companies that actually have put the effort to prepare themselves to put that data, to normalize it, to make it available to these models are going to be the ones benefiting from it, right? And I think that's where again, both with our proprietary software and all the efforts that we've made to kind of make the data available to our own algorithms, we have the ability now to relate these advances of technology and get even more efficiency across many different functions, right? So we're very excited about everything that's happening out there, and we're really happy that we again set ourselves for success by always seeing that future and preparing for it and not waiting for it to happen, actually putting it to work with our own hands, right? So really excited about all that stuff and what it could do for us in the future. Operator (Operator Instructions) Our next question will come from Matt Koranda with ROTH MKM. Michael David Zabran It's Mike Zabran on for Matt. So the recent heavy discounting makes a lot of sense even on the more premier products, but just any visibility on when we can expect a halt or even a reduction in the level of discounting? And to what extent is pulling back on that heavy discounting factored into the second half EBITDA profitability expectation? Yaniv Zion Sarig Arty, I'll let you take that? Arturo Rodriguez Yes. Yes. No, I think again, if you follow discounting and pricing on Amazon, it's a bit dynamic, right? But the point here was if we can clear out all this expensive inventory and normalize our inventory levels, we can bring back to product at normal costing because now we're back to like pre-pandemic pricing from a shipping container perspective. And so as such, the view we've been saying is that as we enter the second half of the year, all that should be normalized. So we should be back to more normalized pricing along with normalized costing to get to a normalized contribution margin or starting to see a good chunk of that in Q3 and into Q4. So that's why we're really pointing towards that same half point. We could get that a little bit earlier into Q2, but we're really not -- we can't really say on that. So that's why we're really focused on the second half right now. Michael David Zabran Okay. So normal level of competitive discounting in the second half of the year, but first half of the year, we should get through all of the discounting to clear the excess inventory. Am I understanding that correct? Arturo Rodriguez Yes, yes. I mean you're always doing some form of discounting and price adjustments just to stay at the competitive landscape depending on the season. That's normal, yes. But yes, you're right. You should see more normal pricing type position as we enter the second half, for sure. Michael David Zabran Got it. That makes sense. Just one more for me. How are we circumventing the Amazon FBA fees? So I understand you guys have 3PL sites and FBA at your disposal, but maybe just speak to how we're optimizing between using Amazon versus 3PL sites to get products to customers. Yaniv Zion Sarig That's actually a great question. And really, the answer is, as you know, Mike, like we put a lot of effort in building a network of 3PLs that's connected to our AIMEE platform which, as you remember, we used to do our own fulfillment for the larger items, but also for the smaller items, which typically gets fulfilled through FBA, we store those items in our own 3PL before we send them to FBA to go to going in fulfilled, right? And the answer to your question relies on really how can we optimize the 3PL distribution of the products that go to FBA to reduce the cost of FBA, meaning if you have -- again, we have, I think, at this point, over 19 3PLs, maybe 1 less because we're optimizing all the time. When our logistics department receives containers, they actually use a bunch of different models that we put together to figure out what's the optimal way to send those inventories to the 3PL. And the goal there for that inventory is to be as close as possible to the FBA warehouses to which we ship them so that we can, a, have less inventory in FBA; and b, spend less money sending it to FBA, which then offsets a little bit some of those kind of higher FBA fees that we're seeing recently, right? So again, our network of warehouses doesn't only give us an advantage when it comes to oversized items because our fulfillment there is quite competitive with FBA. But also for the smaller items, where the fulfillment will happen to FBA, the distribution to be as soon as possible to the FBA centers helped a lot. Operator It appears there are no further questions. This concludes your question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ilya Grozovsky for any closing remarks. Ilya Grozovsky Thanks. As part of our shareholder Perks Program, which, as a reminder, investors can sign up for at www.aterian.io/perks, participants have the ability to ask management questions on our earnings calls. I want to thank all of the shareholder Perks participants for their loyalty, their participation in program and for their questions. I have picked a few of the most popular questions this quarter and that they have sent in. So here they are. First question is, when do you intend to be fully operational in Europe and do you plan to cover more European countries in the future? Yaniv Zion Sarig Thanks, Ilya. So obviously, we're really excited about Europe. It's been something that we wanted to do for a while, but the supply chain crisis was preventing us from making moves a little earlier. But in general, as we mentioned in the prior press release, we already have good infrastructure set up in some of the most important countries. And we currently don't expect to go into further countries in Europe. But really, it's about maximizing what we're already in, which are the biggest markets and just sending more of our products there, right? That's the big effort here in 2023 is now that the supply chain issues are cleared. We're focused on making sure that we can maximize the amount of our existing portfolio products that are not yet in Europe that we can bring to market in Europe, which again, should have a significant effect on 2024, right? Once we've achieved that, we could then look at other countries in Europe, but there's no current plan to do that at this point. There's enough work with what we're doing. Ilya Grozovsky Great. Next question was, when do you expect to clear inventory purchased during COVID and start benefiting from the lower shipping costs? Yaniv Zion Sarig Yes. So as already mentioned as well, right, we made great progress on reducing the inventory. I mean, it was almost -- it was probably $73 million back in June, down to $43 million. We still have a bit of inventory on the balance sheet that remains longer, and we're going to clear it out through the end of the second quarter at most. And really, our target is to get to less than 5% long inventory, which I think at this point is quite achievable based on the progress we've made in Q4 and continuous work in Q1. Ilya Grozovsky Great. Okay. And the last question was what was the health and wellness brand that you acquired in October of 2022? And how will that come to market? Yaniv Zion Sarig Yes. So there was a lot of interest in this. And here's what we want to share, right? So we bought a small competitor to Squatty Potty. It was a competitor that had a product specifically that was competing against that brand and was actually undercutting our price and hurting our sales at the Squatty Potty level. We had the opportunity to acquire this very small brand because they were like a lot of other consumer companies in a difficult position. And we did it really just because we wanted to take control the listing and stop undercutting Squatty Potty, which is a long-term investment, right? Because if we -- if that competitor has gone through the challenges that they had and continue to invest in their business, they could have further chips at our Squatty Potty brand. And so we just took advantage of that and brought that product in, so that they're not a long-term issue for us, right? So... Ilya Grozovsky Got it. Great. This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. In terms of upcoming calendar, Aterian management will be participating in the 35th Annual ROTH Conference, March 12 through 14 in Laguna Niguel, California. We look forward to speaking with you on future calls. This ends our call, and you may now disconnect. Thank you. Operator The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

SVB stock plummeted 68% during Friday's premarket trading session before the halt after dropping more than 60% through Thursday, closing at $106 per share. CNBC's David Faber reported early Friday SVB's planned capital raise announced earlier this week had not cleared the market, and that the firm was now seeking to sell itself. Turmoil for SVB began when the California based bank filed a surprise announcement of a $1.8 billion loss following a deposit outflow and plans to raise $2.25 billion by selling common and preferred stock. Silicon Valley Bank primarily serves startups and technology firms, which have been under pressure as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.  Silicon Valley’s CEO Greg Becker urged calm with venture capitalists Thursday in a call, according to The Information, and asked them not to withdraw money. Bloomberg reported that venture capitalists have urged portfolio companies to trim their exposure to the lender. Another California bank that serves cryptocurrency clients, Silvergate Capital, announced a “voluntary liquidation” Wednesday, the same day Silicon Valley Bank announced its ill-fated capital raise. Shares were also halted in Signature Bank (SBNY), a New York institution that serves some cryptocurrency clients, after its shares dropped more than 16%. First Republic Bank (FRC), which serves some companies in the venture world and also targets high-net worth clients from the tech industry, saw shares fall as much as 40% early Friday. Concerns about risks to other banks spread on Thursday as stocks of giant financial institutions tumbled. A major bank index fell by the most Thursday in nearly three years. Shares for JP Morgan Chase (JPM) fell 5.41% Thursday and shares were roughly flat during Friday's open. Shares of Bank of America (BAC) fell 6.20% Thursday and opened Friday down more than 2%. Citigroup (C) shares fell 4.20% Thursday and opened Friday down more than 1%. Shares of Goldman Sachs Group (GS) fell 7.20% Thursday and an additional 2% Friday. In a Friday morning note, Morgan Stanley analysts said they don’t anticipate this SVB Financial’s challenges will cripple other regional banks. “The funding pressures facing SIVB are highly idiosyncratic and should not be viewed as a read-across to other regional banks,” according to the note. “We do not believe there is a liquidity crunch facing the banking industry, and most banks in our coverage have ample access to liquidity.” David Hollerith is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-10,msft,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-today-live-updates-march-10-2023-123845899.html,"U.S. stock futures were mixed Friday morning ahead of a crucial jobs report that will provide another snapshot of the strength of the economy and provide further clues to the path of the Fed's rate-hiking campaign. Futures tied to the S&P 500 (^GSPC) were down 0.2% ahead of the open, while futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined 0.3%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) edged up by 0.1%. January’s job report blew past expectations, as the U.S. economy added more than half a million jobs and the unemployment rate dipped to 3.4%, a level not seen since 1969. But economists aren’t expecting another surprise for Friday’s February jobs print. Consensus estimates from economists are for job gains of 225,000, a slower pace from the January’s blowout number. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.4%. “Signs of slowing outnumber signs of strength, making the chance that last month was a fluke likely,” Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, wrote in a note Friday morning. “At the same time, labor demand continues strong, which suggests a significant drop is also unlikely. A return to the previous trend makes the most sense.” The Federal Reserve has been keeping a close eye on all fronts to the labor market as the central bank tries to cool down inflation. The Friday’s jobs print will show whether January’s hiring gain was an outlier or the start of economic acceleration. Another key point of focus will be wage growth — and whether or not the trend accelerated last month. Meanwhile, other recent data continues to show the economy remains resilient. Consumer spending surged in January, inflation stayed sticky, and business activity expanded in February. The accumulation of economic data, coupled with comments this week from Chair Jerome Powell, has sparked the debate on whether a 0.25% or 0.50% rate hike from the Fed is likely for its March meeting. However, recent events in the banking world have spurred other concerns for Fed officials as their monetary tightening policy induces stresses into the banking system. A major tech firm lender revealed it’s in deep trouble. Silicon Valley Bank’s (SIVB) share price tanked 60% on Thursday, wiping out $9.6 billion of market value after announcing it needs to raise $2.25 billion to offset a $1.8 billion loss on some bond sales. The sour sentiment has spread across markets as the KBW Bank index (^BKX) was down over 7%, while index members including Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) edged lower Friday morning in premarket trading. Elsewhere, in the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin (BTC) crumbled below $20,000 Friday amid liquidation of Silvergate Capital (SI) and regulatory pressures on the industry. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Economists expect nonfarm payrolls grew by 225,000 last month with the unemployment rate expected to hold steady at 3.4%, according to data from Bloomberg. The BLS will release its latest jobs figures at 8:30 a.m. ET. Here are the key figures investors will be looking for in Friday's report compared to January's figures, according to data from Bloomberg: Nonfarm payrolls: +225,000 vs. +517,000 Unemployment rate: 3.4% vs. 3.4% Average hourly earnings, month-on-month: +0.3% vs. +0.3% Average hourly earnings, year-on-year: +4.7% vs. +4.4% Labor force participation rate: 62.4% vs. 62.4% Average weekly hours worked: 34.6 vs. 34.7 Investors will be paying particularly close attention to revisions to January's data released Friday morning, as investors saw the unexpectedly strong 517,000 jobs created to start the year as a potential outgrowth of seasonal adjustment factors or favorable weather. ""Given the potential impact of weather and seasonality effects in January there is the possibility of another shock last month, albeit mainly to the downside this time,"" wrote Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients earlier this month. Ashworth expects job gains in February will tally 200,000 just below consensus estimates. Friday's report also comes less than two weeks before the Federal Reserve's next policy meeting, with markets now expecting the central bank will raise interest rates by a more aggressive 0.50%. Fed Chair Jay Powell told lawmakers this week ""the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated."" Data from the CME Group shows markets pricing in an 60% of a 0.50% rate hike on March 22.

Follow him on Twitter @MylesUdland and on LinkedIn. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. For the last year, the Federal Reserve has tried to accomplish one goal, using one tool — lower inflation by raising interest rates. The result has been benchmark interest rates rising by 4.5% in a year and headline inflation falling from a peak of 9.1% in June to 6.4% as of January. As Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated in testimony on Capitol Hill this week, there is still work to be done for the Fed to achieve its goal. But over the last week, acute challenges at two banks have surfaced another issue now facing the Powell Fed. And that is the stability of the financial system. On Wednesday, Silvergate Capital (SI), which had become one of the crypto industry's biggest banking partners, announced it will liquidate and wind down operations after suffering significant deposit outflows from its digital asset clients. That same day, Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB), the preferred banking partner of the venture and startup worlds, announced it would take a $1.8 billion loss while liquidating its entire short-term securities book and raising $2.25 billion fresh capital. In a letter to investors, CEO Greg Becker assured investors the bank had ""ample liquidity,"" and said it took these actions ""because we expect continued higher interest rates, pressured public and private markets, and elevated cash burn levels from our clients as they invest in their businesses."" The Information reported Thursday afternoon Becker told investors on a call, ""I would ask everyone to stay calm and to support us just like we supported you during the challenging times."" Few statements have a tougher audience than investors being told to remain calm in times of market stress. On Thursday, U.S. stocks got crushed during a steady, relentless sell-off that centered on the financial sector. Regional banks were hammered. Big banks were hammered. The S&P 500 fell 1.8%. Bitcoin fell 7%. The challenge for Powell, however, is that some of the stress facing Silicon Valley Bank has been induced by the Fed's actions to fight inflation. And the fear is they may not be alone. In the simplest terms, Silicon Valley Bank took a nearly $2 billion hit selling bonds at a loss to buy different bonds that offer a higher yield. The firm's latest annual report showed the bank owned about $14 billion in Treasury securities with an average maturity between 1-5 years. Today, 1-year Treasury bills yield 5.25%. One day's drop in the stock market, of course, is not cause for concern about the financial system. Even the liquidation of one bank and deep investor concerns about another need not constitute a Fed-level worry about the U.S. banking system. But these moves serve as reminders that while the central bank's role in raising or lowering interest rates has become the focal point of investor attention over the last decade, the Fed also serves the central role in stabilizing markets and quelling investor fears during uncertain moments like the present. Almost exactly three years ago, Powell held an emergency Sunday night call on March 15, 2020 to announce a series of measures aimed at supporting the economy as the pandemic rapidly shut down global business. On that call, Powell reminded the assembled press, ""[That] central banks were originally designed to ...provide liquidity to financial systems in stress, so we take that job very seriously. It's probably the most important thing we're doing now is that."" Rising anxiety in the banking system as the ripples from a crypto collapse in 2022 and the icing over of a red hot venture market pale in comparison to the financial emergency the Fed faced three years ago. But their actions then were a reminder of the central bank's power, and, indeed, its centrality to financial markets. When the February jobs report is released Friday morning, investors will pore over the data to decipher whether a 0.25% or 0.50% rate hike from the Fed is likely warranted on March 22. This is the moment markets have been building towards for weeks. But the unforeseen stress now being injected into the banking system makes Friday and the days ahead notable for the Fed in an entirely different manner. That presents to Jay Powell another wrinkle in the challenge of trying to bring order to an economy that busted and boomed in a few short months.

2023-03-10,msft,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/why-silicon-valley-banks-crisis-is-rattling-americas-biggest-banks-121159393.html,"The problems of two small banks on the West Coast are rippling across markets and causing new investor concerns about some of the country’s largest financial institutions. Why? Three words: rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve’s aggressive campaign to bring down inflation helped set the stage for major problems at two California lending institutions — SVB Financial (SIVB) and Silvergate Capital (SI) — as an outflow of deposits forced both to sell assets at a loss. Those assets were bonds. Banks are big investors in assets like Treasury bills because they need lots of safe places to park their cash. Many financial institutions piled into these investments during a period of historically-low interest rates that spanned the early years of the pandemic, as banks took in tons of new deposits and lending was somewhat restrained. But now the Fed is hiking rates at a rapid clip, with Fed Chair Jay Powell warning earlier this week the central bank may have to speed up the pace of its rate increases to cool the economy further. The problem that creates for banks is simple: higher rates lower the value of their existing bonds. The withdrawals at SVB's Silicon Valley Bank have come from startups and technology firms, many of which also ran into new trouble once the Fed began raising rates. The deposit outflow forced SVB to sell assets and take a $1.8 billion loss, a move the bank it made “because we expect continued higher interest rates, pressured public and private markets, and elevated cash-burn levels from our clients as they invest in their businesses.” Its shares fell more than 60% Thursday. In pre-market trade on Friday SVB shares were down another 60% after overnight reporting from Bloomberg said VC firms ranging from Peter Thiel's Founder Fund to Union Square Ventures had told portfolio companies to pull their money from Silicon Valley Bank. Banks don't have to realize losses on bonds that may have gone down in value amid rising rates if they're not pushed to sell these assets. But Silvergate Capital and SVB Financial didn’t have that choice. Customer withdrawals at Silvergate Bank and SVB’s Silicon Valley Bank forced their hand. At Silvergate, which caters to cryptocurrency clients, customers yanked their money in the panic that followed the 2022 collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Silvergate said in January that it had realized losses of $886 million from selling securities as deposits fell. That weakened the bank considerably. On Wednesday it said it would wind down its bank, and its shares plunged Thursday. After disclosing the $1.8 billion loss and new capital raise, Silicon Valley’s CEO Greg Becker urged calm in a call with venture capitalists Thursday, according to The Information, asking these investors not to withdraw money. It now is seeking to raise $2.25 billion of new capital to cover the new losses. The concern now among investors is that much bigger banks could be forced to do the same. That sent the stocks of giant financial institutions tumbling Thursday, including the biggest of the big: JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC). A major bank index fell by the most Thursday in nearly three years. The biggest U.S. banks are much stronger than they were in the lead up to the last big banking crisis, in 2008, in part because regulators forced them to hold more capital and survive numerous stress test scenarios over the last decade and a half. And the giants have more diverse funding and customer bases than banks such as Silicon Valley or Silvergate, which gives them many more options during challenging times. Longtime banking analyst Mike Mayo said Thursday during an appearance on CNBC the biggest banks are ""a pillar of strength and stability"" and much more resilient than they were prior to the 2008 crisis. ""The biggest risks are outside the largest banks,"" he said, and yet all banks are ""getting painted with the same brush."" Bank stocks, he said, ""have gotten Powelled,"" referring to the Fed chair. ""Going from zero to 5% interest rates in a period that is faster than any time in four decades, you are going to have casualties."" Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chair Martin Gruenberg highlighted the new interest rate risks facing the industry during a speech on March 6, noting that unrealized losses on available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities totaled $620 billion at the end of 2022 across all U.S. banks. ""The current interest rate environment has had dramatic effects on the profitability and risk profile of banks’ funding and investment strategies,"" he said. ""First, as a result of the higher interest rates, longer term maturity assets acquired by banks when interest rates were lower are now worth less than their face values. The result is that most banks have some amount of unrealized losses on securities."" These unrealized losses, he added, ""weaken a bank’s future ability to meet unexpected liquidity needs."" The good news, according to Gruenberg, is that ""banks are generally in a strong financial condition, and have not been forced to realize losses by selling depreciated securities.""

2023-03-09,msft,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-today-live-updates-march-9-2023-135006552.html,"Stocks got crushed on Thursday as worries rippled through the banking sector and investors remained on edge ahead of a crucial February jobs report slated for Friday morning. At the closing bell, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down 1.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was off by 1.6%, or 542 points, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down by 2%. Through Thursday's close the market was on pace for its worst week of the year, Bloomberg data showed. The selling on Thursday accelerated throughout the trading session as a collapse in shares of SVB Financial (SIVB) pressured bank stocks and raised concerns over previously unforeseen knock-on effects from the Federal Reserve's rate hiking campaign on the financial system. On Wednesday, SVB announced a $2.25 billion capital raise and the sale of nearly all of its securities portfolio for a loss of $1.8 billion. The company's Silicon Valley Bank subsidiary is the bank for many startups and other players in the venture world. In a letter to investors on Wednesday, the company said: ""We are taking these actions because we expect continued higher interest rates, pressured public and private markets, and elevated cash burn levels from our clients as they invest in their businesses."" The Information reported Thursday afternoon Greg Becker, CEO of Silicon Valley Bank, said on a call with investors, ""I would ask everyone to stay calm and to support us just like we supported you during the challenging times."" Becker also reportedly told investors the bank has ""ample liquidity,"" but said that ""if everyone is telling each other SVB is in trouble, that would be a challenge."" SVB shares fell 60% on Thursday. This decline also weighed on regional banks, with the SPDR Regional Banking ETF (KRE) falling 8% while the SPDR Financial Sector ETF (XLF) fell some 4%. Among major U.S. money-center banks, shares of JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), and Wells Fargo (WFC) were all down more than 5% on Thursday. First Republic Bank (FRC), which maintains a large high net-worth clients business, saw shares fall 16% during Thursday's trading session. As Bloomberg's Jonathan Ferro tweeted, Thursday seems to have marked the moment in the rate-hiking cycle that higher rates are good for banks until they are no longer good. Earlier Thursday, labor market data had been the main catalyst for the market as investors await a crucial jobs report set for release Friday morning. The weekly report on initial filings for unemployment insurance Thursday morning showed 211,000 claims were filed last week, an increase of 21,000 from the prior weak and what economists at Oxford Economics called the ""first hint of weakness"" in this data. ""The jump in jobless claims to 211k last week from 190k is the first sign of weakness in the claims data this year but is still well short of the 300k+ level that would be consistent with a recession,"" Michael Pearce, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients. ""As the Fed presses ahead with more rate hikes, we expect layoffs to eventually rise significantly."" The initial pop from stocks following this data came after two days of testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made clear interest rates are likely to go higher than expected amid strong labor market and inflation data. Stocks finished Wednesday's trading session mixed after a sell-off Tuesday that was triggered by comments from Powell suggesting the Fed will need to raise rates higher than previously forecasted amid stubborn inflation. ""I was surprised by Powell's willingness to accelerate the policy tightening pace, but I am not surprised by the admission that terminal rates will need to rise further,"" said Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro. ""At present, the futures market is priced for a [50 basis point] move in March. There is no point cracking open a door if you don’t intend to walk through."" Data from the CME Group shows markets placing an 80% on the Fed raising rates by 0.50% later this month. Elsewhere in markets, WTI crude oil fell about 1.5% to trade near $75.50 a barrel, a retreat from the $80 a barrel oil was trading near earlier this week. Investors were also keeping a close eye on the Treasury market with the 10-year yield firmer by about 5 basis points, trading at 3.92% after a move higher in yields earlier this week led to a deepening inversion of the yield curve. In single-stock news, shares of Silvergate (SI) were in focus on Thursday after the bank said late Wednesday it would liquidate and wind down its operations after suffering heavy losses amid huge deposit outflows from its digital asset client base. Shares of Silvergate, which have lost more than 95% over the last year, fell 41% on Thursday. Other stocks on the move on Thursday included MongoDB (MDB), which fell 8.3% following a disappointing quarterly report. On the flip side, shares of Asana (ASAN) gained 19% Thursday after a surprisingly strong quarter.

2023-03-09,msft,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/banks-tumble-svb-ignites-broader-173433069.html,"By Sinéad Carew (Reuters) - The S&P 500 bank index tumbled nearly 6% on Thursday in its biggest one-day drop in over two years as investors fled the industry following SVB Financial Group's share sale announcement and crypto bank Silvergate's decision to wind down operations. Shares of SVB, whose operating segments include Silicon Valley Bank, slumped over 50% in their deepest one-day drop on record after the company announced a $1.75 billion share sale late on Wednesday. SVB is battling cash burn due to declining deposits from startups struggling with a venture capital funding drought. San Francisco headquartered First Republic slumped 15% after hitting its lowest level since October 2020. The SPDR S&P regional banking ETF dropped more than 7% to its lowest level since January 2021. Major U.S. banks were also hit, with JPMorgan and Bank of America both down more than 5%. First Republic and SVB were the S&P 500's deepest percentage decliners in Thursday's trading session, while JPMorgan's loss weighed more than any other stock on the S&P 500's 1.1% decline at mid-day. ""The Silicon Valley raise got everybody nervous about people's capital levels and what deposits are doing. A lot of institutional investors don't feel great about owning certain banks right now,"" said R.J. Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. ""It just gets people freaked out because Silicon Valley, historically has been a very strong, well-run bank. If they're having issues right now, people are wondering what about other banks that are lesser quality and that don't have the reputation that Silicon Valley Bank has."" Investors were also grappling with the decline of cryptocurrency-focused lender Silvergate Capital, which dropped 22% after saying late on Thursday it planned to wind down operations and voluntarily liquidate after it was hit with losses following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. Shares in Silvergate peer Signature bank fell 9.4%.

2023-03-09,msft,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/mortgage-rates-increase-again-flirt-with-7-170227323.html,"Mortgage rates surged higher this week, closing in on 7%, further cementing affordability concerns in the housing market. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage increased to 6.73% from 6.65% the week prior, according to Freddie Mac. Rates have climbed nearly three-quarters of a point since the beginning of February. The jump in rates continued to fuel the standoff between price-struck homebuyers and hesitant sellers, as elevated home prices weigh on already weak demand ahead of the spring season. Add to that the expectation that rates could soon crest 7% if inflation remains a top concern. “It's not just higher mortgage rates, but really the combination of higher mortgage rates and still higher home prices in most markets that are creating hurdles for buyers,” Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale, told Yahoo Finance. “Even though a greater share of home sellers in today's market have adjusted their price lower, both listing and sale prices have continued to climb on a year-over-year basis.” While the volume of applications to purchase a home increased by 7% for the week ending March 3, overall purchase activity was 42% lower than a year ago, the Mortgage Bankers Association latest survey found. “Even with this jump in activity, both purchase and refinance applications remain well below year-ago levels when rates were much lower,” MBA President and CEO Bob Broeksmit told Yahoo Finance. “The recent increase in mortgage rates, right at the start of the busy spring buying season, could cause prospective buyers to delay decisions until rates moderate.” Buyers still in the market also have to contend with higher list prices from sellers. The national median listing price increased to $415,000 in February, Realtor.com data showed, up from $406,000 the previous month and up 7.8% year over year. That reverses several months of softening listing prices after peaking in June at $449,000, and could suggest that sellers are getting stubborn in offering incentives. Without wiggle room on prices, buyers are seeing their purchasing power evaporate amid rising interest rates. For instance, the monthly mortgage payment for a median-priced home is 49% higher than a year ago at last week’s rate of 6.65%, according to Realtor.com. Buyers are likely to face further affordability challenges entering the spring, Hale noted, because too-low inventory will continue to buoy home prices. “One big reason that home prices continue to climb is that even though we have more homes for sale today, the market is still not back to what was common before the pandemic in most places,” Hale said. “And fewer homes for sale mean there's still some pressure on prices even though buyers are more selective amid higher costs.” As homebuyer demand remains weak, home sellers are feeling more pessimistic and are much less active than last year. There were 15.9% fewer homes listed for sale in February compared with last year, data from Realtor.com showed. Meanwhile, there’s some evidence that sellers are a bit less generous with buyer incentives. For instance, 57% of builders used incentives to close sales in February, the National Association of Home Builders said, down from 62% in December and 59% in November. A growing share of sellers are also pulling back on price reductions, more so than what is typical during this time of the year. According to Realtor.com, 13% of home sellers issued a price cut in February, up from 5.4% a year ago. Still, in January at least 15.3% of sellers lowered their prices to make a sale. Mortgage rates have been marching higher since February after government data revealed the inflation remains a threat. This week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell made it clear to Congress that he isn’t ready to soften his aggressive fight on inflation, indicating that further rate hikes would likely be necessary as we enter the spring. That could likely keep mortgage rates higher. Though “forecasting is far more art than science,” Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com, anticipates that mortgage rates are likely to climb higher before they retreat later this year. “At present, and while there is a chance that rates could retreat to recent bottom levels or perhaps a little below at some point, much depends on what happens with prices, with the Fed, and ultimately whether or not the economy gets to a tipping point and starts to head into recession,” Gumbinger recently told Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-09,msft,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/9-ways-biden-is-set-to-raise-some-taxes-in-2024-budget-proposal-145357176.html,"President Biden is set to lay out vast and expensive ambitions in his 2024 budget Thursday from shoring up Medicare and boosting domestic spending to reducing the deficit by nearly $3 trillion over the coming decade. To pay for it all, he plans to propose a slate of tax increases, according to multiple peeks at the budget administration officials gave in recent days. There are new taxes on the business world focused on raising the rate on corporate income and on stock buybacks. He will also propose new taxes on wealthy Americans — from changes to how investment income is taxed to a revival of his ""billionaire minimum tax"" on wealth. “I want to make it clear I’m going to raise some taxes,” President Biden said during a recent stop in Virginia, offering one of his many previews of what's to come. Of course, presidential budget proposals are largely symbolic documents that are more about staking out a position rather than being enacted. But they serve as an important marker of Biden’s priorities for the year ahead. “What the president has really here to use is the bully pulpit, meaning once he puts his budget forward, is he going to continue to push some of those ideas?” asked Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget President Maya MacGuineas in a Yahoo Finance Live interview on Wednesday. “If he's serious about it, he'll push it.” Here are some of the new taxes set to be unveiled on Thursday In his budget, President Biden is set to renew his long-standing calls for more taxes on Corporate America. Included in a New York Times preview of the budget document are Biden’s desire to raise the corporate income tax rate to 28% from its current level of 21%. The president is also set to renew his call to quadruple the recently enacted excise tax on stock buybacks, a change he first offered earlier this year during his State of the Union address. On Jan. 1, a new 1% tax on share repurchases went into effect, but has done little to damp business enthusiasm for the practice. The provision is currently set to bring in about $74 billion over the coming decade, and Biden is proposing to increase the rate to 4%. And according to a document reviewed by Reuters, the budget will also propose scrapping tax breaks that oil and gas companies receive. That could likely open up another front in the back and forth between the White House and oil companies over record profits they've enjoyed since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The new proposals come after last year’s Inflation Reduction Act imposed multiple new taxes on businesses, including the 1% stock buyback excise tax and a new corporate book minimum tax. Going after more taxes so shortly after last year's victory likely will inflame critics. Erica York, a senior economist at the Tax Foundation, argued in an interview Wednesday with Yahoo Finance that Biden’s policies were already “heading in the wrong direction and the president's budget is going to double down on that.” “I would say wait and see how it plays out before you double down or quadruple down on it,” she added. Biden is also set to propose new taxes on Americans making over $400,000 a year. The president rolled out his most controversial proposal during this year’s State of the Union with a potential new tax that would target wealth, not just income. “We have to reward work, not just wealth,” President Biden said in his speech. “No billionaire should be paying a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter.” According to a preview offered to Bloomberg, the president will lay out new details on that, including a call for a 25% minimum tax on households worth more than $100 million as well as an increase in the capital gains rate for wealthy Americans. Other tax ideas that were present in previous budgets are set to be revived for 2024, including ending the so-called carried-interest loophole and eliminating some tax breaks around real-estate profits. All told, the various increases would fund nearly $3 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade and also fund other Biden priorities. The deficit reduction will come in a budget that “achieves this while lowering costs for families, investing in America, and protecting programs Americans have paid into because it proposes tax reforms to ensure the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share, while cutting wasteful spending on special interests — interests like Big Oil and Big Pharma,” Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Wednesday. Finally, the White House previewed new taxes to shore up the Medicare program earlier this week. Biden will propose increases on payroll taxes on Americans making over $400,000 per year; closing loopholes that shields some “pass-through” income from Medicare taxes; and allowing Medicare to negotiate on a wider array of prescription drugs. Those provisions, which Biden reviewed in a New York Times op-ed on Tuesday, would extend the program through 2050. Critics have noted that many of these proposals would be untested ways to fund the health care program for retirees. York also noted that some of the rule changes around the net investment income tax would help Medicare's finances by diverting some money from the government’s general fund. “Of course that looks like you're strengthening Medicare, but you're creating a hole in the budget elsewhere,” she said, noting the plan also increases the net investment income tax from 3.8% to 5% and would therefore also bring in more money overall. Republicans have been promising for weeks that Biden’s proposals won’t see the light of day. This is hardly new — there's an old saying in Washington about budgets that “the president proposes and Congress disposes” — but it will nevertheless increase pressure on House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) to offer his own proposal in the coming months. MacGuineas, who previewed the dueling proposals, noted that the White House budget will likely focus on tax increases and the GOP plan will revolve around spending cuts. “Neither of them is realistic, and, frankly, neither of them is the right policy,” she said. “We need compromises on both.” Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. Fed chair Jay Powell just poured cold water on the ""no landing"" crowd hoping to avert a U.S. recession and rally stocks to fresh record highs this year. After two days of grilling before Congress, investors have been reminded (again) that the Fed chief still sees inflation as a persistent, pernicious threat. Stocks and bonds took notice Wednesday, as both sold off amid surging short-term rates — leaving the major indices underwater for the week as of the close. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes,"" said Powell before the Senate. And with two weeks to go until the next Fed meeting, markets are now expecting exactly that. Bonds and derivatives are pricing in a more hawkish outcome — expecting the Fed to lift its benchmark rate 50 basis points instead of 25 basis points. Since Monday's settlement, the U.S. 2-year Treasury-Note yield has surged 18 basis points to 5.06% — the highest level since 2007. It also deepened its inversion over the 10-year yield, with the spread reaching negative 108 basis points (or -1.08 percentage points) — the highest since the early 1980s when Paul Volcker was the Fed chair fighting a similar battle over price inflation. Under normal conditions, interest rates of longer-term loans or bonds (the cost of money) are expected to be more expensive than their shorter-term counterparts, as risk is higher on the long end. But this changes when the Fed starts stamping out animal spirits, lifting short-term rates to restrict the creation of credit and eventually choke off growth. While the magnitude, or depth, of a yield curve inversion isn't necessarily predictive of a deeper, or longer recession, there are a host of other indicators in the bond market that are sounding alarm bells. Former bond trader and CEO of TheMacroCompass.com Alfonso Peccatiello recently joined Yahoo Finance Live to offer his insights. Peccatiello notes that the bond market expects the Fed to fight inflation and remain tight, with interest rates well over 5% a year from now. ""That cannot happen if a recession is unfolding. The Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates,"" he said. Essentially, the inflation-fighting credibility that Powell has earned in the markets comes with a cost — pushing expectations of Fed capitulation far beyond what occurs historically. ""The issue is — the tighter you keep borrowing conditions for the private sector, the higher you keep mortgage rates, the higher you keep corporate borrowing rates — the higher the chances you're going to freeze these credit markets and basically sleepwalk into an accident or, in general, accelerate a recession later on,"" said Peccatiello. But long before the Fed delivers relief in the form of cuts, Peccatiello expects stocks to suffer from an earnings recession, which, he says, ""isn't fully priced in."" (An earnings recession — marked by two consecutive quarterly declines in S&P 500 earnings — often, but not always precedes an economic recession.) Peccatiello believes the U.S. is already in an earnings recession, with stocks reflecting complacency. Nevertheless, he doesn't expect a disaster. He sees about 10% maximum downside risk in the S&P 500 down to the 3600 level, which is right around last year's lows. ""I don't think it's going to be much lower than that,"" he says, adding, ""[T]he stock market generally bottoms before earnings bottom."" The reason gets back to the Fed, which historically capitulates and slashes rates as earnings drop. The Fed rate cuts then get incorporated into better stock valuations, which eventually halt the decline in stock prices, Peccatiello added. ""[This] means the stock market can stop its decline and start slowly but surely moving into a new bull market.""

""We have not made any decision,"" he told the House Financial Services Committee, saying key reports on employment and inflation would govern any moves. The remarks came a day after he told the Senate Banking Committee that, ""we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes"" if the data supported it. That spurred traders to price in a higher chance of a 0.50% hike than a 0.25% increase later this month. “We're going to be looking at the totality of data,"" Powell said Wednesday during questioning from House members. ""We are not on a preset path,"" he added. Powell said the Fed wants to see the upcoming employment report Friday, along with key inflation reports on the consumer and producer price indexes, before making a judgment. On Wednesday, the Dow dropped 0.18%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.14%, and the Nasdaq rose 0.40%. When asked by Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D, Mass.) whether the Fed would pause interest rates to avoid a recession, the chairman called it a serious question and noted that he wouldn’t say yes or no. The Fed, he said, is not ""seeking a recession."" Powell also said the era of low interest rates is likely over. ""Now, we have the 10-year [Treasury yield] back close to 4%,"" said Powell. ""And I think, we need to be careful not to assume that these secular low, longer term rates, will continue indefinitely because it doesn't look likely now."" Democrats, including Democratic Ranking Member Maxine Waters (D, CA) asked him to comment on the prospect of a U.S. default if Congress is not able to raise the debt ceiling. Powell warned that the Fed can’t protect the economy from brinksmanship or a default. ""No one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the non-payment of the government's bills, let alone a debt default, which I don't think will happen, but no one should think we have the tools to protect against the effects of that,"" said Powell. When asked whether the Fed would accept a trillion-dollar coin to avoid a debt default, Powell said there are no rabbits to be pulled out of hats and that would be a ""rabbit coming out of a hat."" House Republicans expressed concerns about reviewing and potentially increasing capital requirements for banks. Patrick McHenry, the chairman of the House committee, questioned the motivation of a ""holistic review"" of these requirements from the Fed’s Vice Chair of Supervision Michael Barr, saying the Fed shouldn’t operate in the shadows when the regulation in question can have broad and significant economic effects. McHenry also accused the Fed of laying the groundwork for a new climate policy. ""The Fed needs to stick to its knitting,"" said McHenry. ""I agree there is concern for many that the Fed is picking up new needles and knitting partisan sweaters at such a precarious time for our economy here at home in the global economy. That would be a mistake."" Powell’s comments Wednesday were his last before the Fed’s policy meeting in two weeks.

2023-03-08,msft,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-march-8-2023-124051164.html,"U.S. stocks finished mixed on Wednesday, following two job prints that showed the labor market remains tight amid sticky inflation. Wall Street also heard from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday morning. Powell continued to stress that ""no decision"" has been made on the size of the Fed's upcoming interest-rate increase at its March policy meeting. ""When say we will look at the totality of data, that will include these next reports. We will carefully analyze. Haven't made a decision on the March meeting. Larger point is that we are not on a preset path,"" said Powell during his second day of testimony before Congress. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended the day up 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined by 0.2%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added 0.4%. Bond yields inched higher alongside a stronger dollar. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked up to 3.98% Wednesday. U.S. stocks plummeted Tuesday after Powell said during his Senate Banking Committee testimony that interest rates may rise “higher” than previously expected as the Fed continues a persistent fight against inflation. Powell’s comments on Capitol Hill triggered a 1.5% selloff in equities, according to JP Morgan’s trading desk. Tuesday’s losses saw every sector lower, with financials and real estate logging the biggest declines for the day. Treasury yields were higher, with the 2-year yield tipping above 5%, while the spread between the 10-year and 2-year US Treasury yields inverted for the first time since September 1981. According to strategists at Deutsche Bank, reaching this level signals a recession could be underway or has occurred within a maximum of eight months. “Powell’s speech indicates that the Fed will heavily depend on near-term data for upcoming rates decisions,” Michael Feroli, Chief U.S. Economist at JP Morgan, wrote in a note Wednesday morning. ""With January’s macro data mostly printing on the hawkish side, NFP Friday and CPI next Tuesday are the most critical catalysts for Fed’s decision between 25bp and 50bp,” Feroli added. Still, on the economic data side, ADP’s monthly read on private payroll growth rose by 242,000 in February, above consensus expectations for 200,000. ADP also tracked pay growth for those workers who stayed in their position, which decelerated to 7.2% last month, the slowest pace of gains within in the last year. “There is a tradeoff in the labor market right now,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist, ADP, wrote in the press release. ""We're seeing robust hiring, which is good for the economy and workers, but pay growth is still quite elevated. The modest slowdown in pay increases, on its own, is unlikely to drive down inflation rapidly in the near term.” Meanwhile, the U.S. monthly international trade deficit increased to $68.3 billion in January, below the consensus deficit of $68.7 billion as imports increased more than exports, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the U.S. Census Bureau. Another highlight Wednesday morning was January’s report on the number of job openings, which fell to 10.82 million, down from the upwardly revised 11.2 million openings in the prior month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. The construction, leisure, hospitality, and finance industries showed significant pullbacks in job openings. ""While the January JOLTS report shows job openings are heading in the right direction for the Fed, the decline is far too modest to convince that labor market conditions are cooling enough to bring down inflation,"" Matthew Martin, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a statement following the release. February’s jobs report out on Friday will hold more clues about the strength of the economy. Economists expect 215,000 new jobs will be added to the economy, a slower pace than January’s blowout number of 517,000 job additions. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.4%. Another key point from the reading will be wage growth, with a 0.3% month-to-month bump in average hourly earnings anticipated and 4.7% over the last year. In single-stock moves, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) gained over 2% Wednesday after a regulatory filing revealed that Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway bought nearly 6 million shares of the oil company in recent days, raising its stake in the company to 200.2 million shares worth $12.2 billion. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD) shares rose 3% Wednesday after the security software provider reported fourth-quarter earnings that topped analysts' expectations and issued stronger guidance for the fiscal first quarter. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) dipped 3% as Berenberg analyst Adrian Yanoshik slashed his rating on the stock from buy to hold, citing ""based on misplaced fears of a price war – appears to have been accepted by the market,"" Yanoshik noted. Separately, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened an investigation into the Model Y SUV over a concern with its steering wheels. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-08,msft,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/key-recession-indicator-yield-inversion-treasury-160255114.html,"The Treasury market is sending its sharpest warning about recession risks since 1981. On Tuesday, the difference in the yield on 2-year and 10-year Treasury notes further inverted, with the yield on the 10-year falling 103 basis points, or 1.03 percentage points, below the yield on the 2-year yield. This dynamic has preceded each of the last eight U.S. recessions. By this measure, the yield curve has been inverted since July of last year as investors bet aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve to combat inflation would tip the economy into recession. In an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled the central bank will likely be more aggressive than it previously forecast in raising interest rates this year as inflation proves stubborn and the labor market remains strong. ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,"" Powell told the Senate Banking Committee in prepared remarks. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes."" ""Although inflation has been moderating in recent months, the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy,"" Powell added. The Fed will announce its next policy decision on March 22, a statement that will also be accompanied by new projections on where Fed officials see interest rates headed over the rest of this year and the next two. Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients Tuesday that Powell ""opened the door for the central bank to accelerate the pace of rate hikes and raise the target range of the fed funds rate more than anticipated because of the recent hot data on job growth and inflation."" Sweet noted investors are now pricing in 100 basis points of additional rate hikes from the Fed this year, up from the 75 basis points previously expected by most economists. Data from the CME Group showed Wednesday morning markets are now pricing in a nearly 80% chance the Fed raises rates by 50 basis points, or 0.50%, at its meeting later this month. As Yahoo Finance's Brian Cheung noted last year, there is nothing about Treasury yields themselves, or the relationship between the yield at any two points along the curve, that signals recession. Rather, it is what yields imply about future interest rates — and in turn future economic growth — that offers worrying signs for investors. While it is hotly debated what, exactly, ""goes into"" the yield for any Treasury security, a simple axiom used by many investors says Treasury yields indicate what the expected average of the fed funds rate, or the Fed's benchmark interest rate, will be over a given time period. With the 2-year yield standing at around 5% as of Wednesday morning, this implies investors think the fed funds rate will be, on average, 5% over the next two years. Today, the fed funds rate stands at roughly 4.6%, as the Fed's target interest rate range is 4.5%-4.75% following its decision last month to raise rates an additional 25 basis points. Therefore, we can say investors are anticipating the Fed will raise rates to at least 5% and keep them there for two years, or raise rates above 5% for some period of time before cutting them such that the average Fed funds rate is 5%. Duke professor Campbell Harvey, who uncovered this ""recession indicator"" in the 1980s, told Bloomberg in an interview earlier this year he thinks the economy can avoid recession despite warnings coming from his work. In part, in Harvey's view, this is because market awareness of this indicator has lessened its potency as a predictive measure. Notably, Harvey's worked actually focused on the spread between the 3-month Treasury bill and the 10-year Treasury note as the most potent recession indicator, not the now-popular 2-year/10-year spread. The spread between these two tenors along the curve currently stands at minus 107 basis points, still a clear recession signal by Harvey's work.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. The retail business is simple — buy from wholesalers, sell to consumers, pocket the difference. In exchange for capturing this difference between the wholesale and retail cost of goods, retailers take on the financial risk of fronting money to one party while working to make it back and then some from another. At the scale of the U.S. consumer economy, the differences between an additional week in a quarter, an additional weekend in a month, or even an additional day in a year can be millions of dollars or more. And if the timing of a day or two can disrupt the financial fortunes of a business — meaning there can be just hours between profits and losses — then one can imagine the challenges faced by retailers during the supply chain disruptions that results from the pandemic. In 2021, the story was that retailers were unable to match consumer demand as the economy re-opened. In 2022, supply chains that got unstuck eventually left retailers with more stock than they needed. As 2023 gets underway, retailers are suggesting the balance may finally be just right. Sporting goods retailer Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) reported fourth quarter results Tuesday morning that impressed investors, with shares rising 11% after the company offered a full-year earnings forecast well above expectations. And driving this profit forecast were inventories that are in ""great shape"" ahead of the company's busy spring season. ""As planned, we continued to address targeted inventory overages, and as a result our inventory is in great shape as we start 2023. We couldn't be more excited about our spring assortment,"" said Lauren Hobart, president and CEO. Dick's CFO Navdeep Gupta added on a call with analysts Tuesday morning, ""We were chasing inventory last year amidst industry-wide supply chain disruptions. ...Compared to Q4 of 2019, a 38% increase in sales was well ahead of our 29% increase in inventory. Our inventory is healthy and well positioned."" Looking at economy-wide data, we can see inventory-to-sales levels are still depressed relative to pre-pandemic levels. Though this measure is in part driven by strong sales, which keeps the ratio of inventories to sales low. Still, comments from Dick's were the latest echo of a refrain heard often from the industry as retail results have poured in over the last few weeks. And that refrain says the industry is finally finding something like a ""normal"" setting after three pandemic-altered years. Back in late February, Walmart (WMT) CEO Doug McMillon said his team, ""acted quickly and aggressively to address the inventory and cost challenges we faced last year."" ""We ended the quarter with inventory about flat to last year which is better than we anticipated and even better when you consider how inflation lifts that number,"" McMillon added on a call with analysts. ""And [we] did it while improving in-stock levels."" McMillon added: ""And so as we look at where we are today with much better position around inventory...I feel like this year will be more of a normal environment for markdowns or certainly more normal than what it was last year."" The company did, however, say there was ""work to be done"" on its apparel inventory levels. But clothing retailers Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN) both indicated in their latest reports inventory levels continue to improve. ""Despite an increasingly volatile macroeconomic climate, through the ongoing execution of our Polaris strategy, we remained agile, pivoted to meet customer demand and elevated our approach to inventory management,” said Jeff Gennette, Macy's chairman and CEO. ""In the fourth quarter, we benefited from our disciplined inventory approach."" The company reported inventory levels that were down 3% from last year and said, ""Inventory productivity continues to be a focus for the company in 2023 and beyond."" Nordstrom, for its part, said inventory levels were down 15% from last year and at levels similar to those that prevailed in 2019, the last year before the pandemic. ""We took decisive actions to right-size our inventory as we entered the new year, positioning us for greater agility amidst continuing macroeconomic uncertainty,"" said CEO Erik Nordstrom.

At the closing bell on Tuesday, the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 1.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) sunk 1.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) plummeted 1.2%. Tuesday's losses saw the S&P 500 fall by the most in two weeks and trade back below the key 4,000 level. The index also broke its 50-day moving average, an indicator traders closely watch for signs stocks are breaking from recent trends. ""Fed Chair Jerome Powell confirmed today that interest rates are set to rise higher than we previously anticipated,"" wrote Andrew Hunter, deputy chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. ""But with most evidence still pointing to economic weakness and markedly lower inflation this year, we still believe the Fed will begin cutting rates again sooner than markets are expecting."" Powell delivered the first of his two days of semi-annual testimony to Congress on Tuesday, speaking before the Senate Banking Committee ahead of Wednesday's appearance before the House Financial Services Committee. In his prepared testimony released Tuesday, Powell spoke of a sustained central bank campaign to rein in inflation. ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,"" Powell said. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes."" Answering questions from lawmakers, Powell said the full impacts of the Fed's interest rate increases haven't yet been felt in the economy. Markets have begun to price in at least two additional 0.25% rate hikes from the central bank over its next two meetings; investors began the year with optimism the Fed would stop its rate-hiking campaign as soon as February. Powell's comments Tuesday opened the door to the possibility of both a higher terminal federal funds rate, as well as a higher pace of increases. According to data from CME Group, Powell's comments spurred traders to price in a higher chance of a 0.50% hike than a 0.25% increase later this month. The Fed will kick off its next two-day policy meeting in two weeks, with a policy announcement set for the afternoon of March 22. Elsewhere in markets, WTI crude oil was under pressure, falling more than 3.7% to around $77.40 per barrel. The 10-year Treasury yield, which has been a focal point of market action over the last few weeks, was little-changed, settling near 3.98%. On the earnings side, results from Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) early this morning sent shares of the sporting goods retailer higher by 11%. The company offered full-year earnings per share guidance that came in more than $1 per share above expectations, according to Bloomberg data. Dick's expects to earn $12.90-$13.80 per share in its fiscal 2023, up from the $12.04 the company earned last year.

Elsewhere in single-stock moves, shares of Snap (SNAP) gained more than 9% on Monday — and had been up as much as 4% on Tuesday before paring gains to close up just 0.5% — with Bloomberg attributing the rally to optimism over a TikTok ban in the U.S. Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"
2023-03-07,msft,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/powell-tells-congress-rates-will-likely-be-higher-than-previously-anticipated-150011657.html,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Tuesday interest rates are likely to rise more than previously expected as the central bank works to bring down inflation, which remains stubbornly above the central bank's 2% target. U.S. stocks were trading lower Tuesday as some analysts said the comments were more hawkish than expected. Near 2:20 p.m. ET, the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) was near session lows, falling 1.5%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) off 1.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) falling 1.2%. ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,"" Powell told the Senate Banking Committee in prepared remarks. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes."" ""Although inflation has been moderating in recent months, the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy,"" Powell added. The latest Consumer Price Index report released last month showed prices rose 6.4% over the prior year in January, a slowdown from last summer's peak inflation rate of 9.1% but still well above the Fed's 2% target. Powell's comments spurred traders to price in a higher chance of a 0.50% hike than a 0.25% increase later this month, according to data from CME Group. In a note, Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner said Powell’s remarks ""opened the door"" to a return of 0.50% hikes, ""If the incoming data flow warrants it."" If there are ""upside surprises"" in a jobs report this Friday from the Labor Department, that could ""drive a faster and longer tightening cycle,"" according to Zentner's note. The Fed projected at its December policy meeting interest rates would need to rise to a range of 5%-5.25% this year, though Powell's comments now suggest rates will need to eventually rise above this level. Following the Fed's February policy decision, the central bank's benchmark interest rate stands in a range of 4.5%-4.75%. Some Senate Democrats challenged Powell during Tuesday’s hearing, cautioning that his rate hikes could lead to job losses. Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown (D-OH) said there are other ways to bring down prices, citing the strengthening of supply chains, boosting of U.S. manufacturing and the rebuilding of infrastructure. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said if the central bank raises rates as much as planned, to 5%-5.25% excluding any further rate hikes Powell has now suggested above that level, unemployment would rise to 4.6%. That, she said, would cost two million people jobs. ""Chair Powell, if you could speak directly to the two million hardworking people who have decent jobs today, who you're planning to get fired over the next year, what would you say to them?"" Warren asked. Powell, in response, said: ""I would explain to people more broadly that inflation is extremely high and it's hurting the working people of this country badly. All of them, not just two million of them, but all of them are suffering under high inflation, and we are taking the only measures we have to bring inflation down."" In a hat tip to these concerns, Powell said in his prepared remarks that the Fed is ""acutely aware"" high inflation is causing ""significant hardship"" for Americans while also pledging to “stay the course until the job is done."" The Fed chair said Tuesday policymakers will continue to make decisions on a meeting by meeting basis. Powell noted that economic data from January on inflation, job growth, consumer spending, and manufacturing production have partly reversed course from the slowdown seen back in December. Powell attributed some of the softening to unseasonably warm weather in January, but cautioned that the ""breadth of the reversal"" suggests inflation is running higher than expected. He reiterated the Fed still needs to see a drop in services inflation excluding housing to bring inflation down, which is likely to require a weaker job market.

2023-03-07,msft,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/heres-what-biden-wants-to-do-to-shore-up-medicare-135302609.html,"President Biden is set to formally release his 2024 budget proposal later this week and is already offering previews on what he plans to do with Medicare. In new details released Tuesday to keep the program afloat into the 2050s, Biden says he can extend the solvency of the program without any benefit cuts via three moves: an increase on the tax rate on both earned and unearned income above $400,000; the closing of loopholes that shields some “pass-through” income from Medicare taxes; and allowing Medicare to negotiate on a wider array of prescription drugs. And overall, the president is looking at least five different tax changes for wealthy Americans and corporations to pay for his myriad ideas — both for Medicare and his larger push to “invest in America” and pay down the deficit. And while the proposal isn’t likely to get a vote on Capitol Hill, it will serve as an important marker of Biden’s priorities. The early focus on Medicare — as well as Social Security — underlines just how “deeply embedded” the twin programs have become in Biden’s political identity, Alex Lawson, the executive director of a group called Social Security Works, recently noted in an interview. The president talks nearly every week about the program and also released a New York Times op-ed on the topic Tuesday morning. Defending the programs now “seems to be one of the defining characteristics of Biden-world,” Lawson added. What the White House appears to be doing with this week’s choreographed multi-day rollout — culminating in a formal unveiling on Thursday in Philadelphia — is an attempt to shape the conversation as both the debt ceiling fight heats up this summer and a likely Biden 2024 re-election campaign kicks off. In the op-ed released Tuesday morning, President Biden wrote that “Medicare is more than a government program. It’s the rock-solid guarantee that Americans have counted on to be there for them when they retire."" The issue is top of mind with a key Medicare trust fund likely to run low on funds as early as 2028, according to a recent government trustees report. Meanwhile, Social Security likely has the funds to continue paying out current benefits for only a few years longer, through 2034. Biden’s proposal would increase the Medicare tax rate from 3.8% to 5% on all income above $400,000. It would also target what is known as net investment income - an additional fee on the returns for high-income earners as well as “pass through” business for Americans above $400,000 per year. The White House aims to change the rules and close loopholes around that income, which it notes can be shielded from the taxes that fund the Medicare program because it is classified currently as “neither earned income nor investment income.” The proposal would close loopholes in that area and also change the government's rules to allow that money to be sent to Medicare’s crucial Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, President of the American Action Forum, noted in a Yahoo Finance Live interview on Tuesday that the net investment tax piece is ""really using a tool that has never been used in Medicare before [and] it's not a particularly good piece of tax policy."" Holtz-Eakin, a Republican and former director of the Congressional Budget Office, added that the way to get these programs under control fiscally is to control growth, and ""you can't tax your way out of this."" The budget will also propose savings via new prescription drug reforms by giving Medicare the authority to negotiate prices for additional higher-cost drugs. The White House estimates these changes will save $200 billion over the coming decade. “There are ways in which the program can be operated more efficiently,” said Paul Van de Water, a Medicare specialist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who also listed other options for the years ahead like lowering payment rates to healthcare providers and limiting payments to Medicare Advantage. But even with all that, “it's still going to be essential we think to raise additional revenues,” he said. Van de Water also noted that Biden has previously proposed changes to the net investment income tax during a previous budget proposal. Thursday’s release will be Biden’s third since taking office. Tuesday’s unveiling is just the first step in what is much more detail to come about Biden's ideas and how he’ll pay for it all. In a recent online video, Biden’s budget director, Shalanda Young, outlined the overall priorities, including expanding the economy, lowering costs, protecting Social Security and Medicare as well as reducing the deficit by $2 trillion over the coming decade. So what other tax increases could be proposed? Administration officials say that both wealthy Americans and corporations will be the focus. In his State of the Union, Biden called to quadruple the excise tax on stock buybacks and to institute a new ""billionaire minimum tax"" on wealth. Both appear set for repeat appearances on Thursday. The president could also call to raise the top corporate tax rate, which would come in addition to a corporate minimum tax instituted last year as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. While House Republicans have pledged that all tax increases are off the table and won't be considered in the House. But the move will increase the pressure on Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) to release his own plan, something he has promised is coming soon. What Speaker McCarthy has discussed in the past is creating the “path” to balance the budget. House Republicans have already floated some small-scale proposals — targeting things like Medicaid and what they term as “woke waste.” What’s unclear — and Democrats and some budget experts charge is impossible — is how that plan takes a significant bite out of the deficit if Social Security, Medicare, and tax increases are all off the table. “We’re not going to sit here and be lectured by those folks about fiscal responsibility,” Biden said recently in a preview of the likely debate to come, adding of the GOP, it will “be interesting to see what they want to cut and what their numbers add up to.” This post has been updated.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. When Fed Chair Jay Powell settles in for his semi-annual testimony to the Senate Banking Committee today, investors will be looking for confirmation that the central bank is going to keep raising interest rates for the next several meetings to fight inflation. Besides the ongoing debate about whether the Fed’s actions are going to send the U.S. economy into recession and stocks into a tailspin, there’s been one other important side effect: the bond market is the hottest it’s been in years. That’s newly true not just for institutional investors, but for retail traders as well. That’s because online trading of Treasuries is accessible at a critical mass for the first time with rates at these levels. It's never been easier to buy, be it directly via the Treasury Department, from the discount brokerages, or through ETFs. The repricing of rate expectations this year has sent yields on many Treasury notes and bonds to their highest in 15 years, with the 2-year, 10-year (TNX), and 30-year all yielding around 4%. It’s been a huge shift for fixed income. Besides institutional investors salivating over government and corporate debt, retail traders are so keen they've repeatedly crashed the TreasuryDirect website, which provides a conduit to Treasuries and I bonds. (The latter is an inflation-protected instrument that has both a fixed rate and one that changes with inflation). “For pretty much the entire decade, leading up to this year, when people asked about retail and fixed income, I could just simply say, ‘no one really cares.’ The past year, that has significantly changed,” Shawn Cruz, Head Trading Strategist at TD Ameritrade, told Yahoo Finance. Sales of Treasury bills – those with maturities of one year or less – through TreasuryDirect were $12.0 billion in January, a record. Before last August, that number hadn’t cracked $5 billion. Net sales of I bonds were $4.2 billion in January, after spiking to $6.8 billion last October. Salim Ramji, Global Head of iShares and Index Investments at BlackRock, was enthusiastic about fixed income when he recently spoke to Yahoo Finance: “It’s a great time for investors to look for yield, but they don’t have to take the kind of risk that they might have two, three, four years ago, because you can get 4% yields in Treasuries. You can get 5% yields in investment grade, even at the front end.” BlackRock, as the largest provider of ETFs by assets, has benefited from the boom. Thus far in 2023, investors have poured $9.9 billion into U.S. iShares fixed income ETFs. And not all investors are going long; the firm’s most popular instrument in February in the category was the iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF (SHV). How long will the party last? Even if the Fed raises interest rates at its next three meetings, some strategists have called for a longer period of higher inflation and higher interest rates, an end to the so-called “Great Moderation.”  BlackRock predicts that fixed income ETF assets under management will reach $5 trillion by 2030. As Ramji said, “Having rates as low as they were for as long as they were was kind of the aberration. I think we’re resetting back now to a much more normal fixed income environment, and the great thing for investors, as a result, is they can use it to generate income, and so for retirees or people looking at their wealth portfolios, they’re able to generate good, long-term income from long-term investments like Treasuries or investment grade.” In other words, for a lot of retail investors right now, boring is beautiful. - Economy Wholesale Inventories, January Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before Senate Banking Committee Earnings Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS); Casey's General (CASY); CrowdStrike (CRWD); Manchester United (MANU); Sea Limited (SE); Stitch Fix (SFIX); Thor Industries (THO) Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended the session near the flatline, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) increased 0.1%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) edged down 0.1%, reversing its gains from earlier in the trading session. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note hovered near 4% Monday afternoon, before settling at 3.98%. Crude oil traded higher, with U.S. benchmark WTI up at $80.55 a barrel. The dollar index moved lower trading at $104.34. U.S. stocks gained on Friday to close out a volatile week, while bond yields pulled back from their recent highs. The three major indexes rose for the week, with the Dow Jones adding 1.7%, the S&P 500 closing 1.9% higher, and the Nasdaq gaining 2.6%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury settled back below the key 4% level, and the two-year yield fell to 4.86%. Economic data released on Friday showed the services sector grew in February. This week, Wall Street will be paying close attention to the monthly jobs report out Friday. The February jobs report is expected to show 215,000 new jobs have been added to the economy, according to economist estimates, a slower pace from January’s blowout number of 517,000 job additions. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.4%. Another key point from the report will be wage growth, with a 0.3% month-to-month bump in average hourly earnings anticipated and 4.7% over the last year. Economists at Bank of America, led by Michael Gapen, believe a deceleration from January will be tied largely to weather shifts and a general mean-reverting nature of payrolls. ""Typically, when payroll growth records a sizable increase or decrease, we see a reversal in the following month,"" the firm noted. Also, investors will be keeping an eye on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's two-day biannual monetary policy testimony on Capitol Hill, which begins Tuesday. Other highlights this week include ADP’s monthly read on private payroll growth, January’s report on job openings from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Fed’s Beige Book. In single stock moves, Apple (AAPL) shares gained nearly 2% on Monday as Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng initiated coverage of Apple with a buy rating and a price target of $199. Ng noted Apple's success in hardware design and brand loyalty has led to a growing installed base of users that provide visibility into revenue growth. And Apple's valuation is attractive relative to its historical multiple and to peers. Ciena (CIEN) shares jumped 4% Monday after the company posted better than expected results that topped analysts expectations amid strong demand in its networking platforms business. Shares of BridgeBio Pharma (BBIO) surged more than 50% after the company topped Wall Street's expectations in a study of children with achondroplasia, a genetic condition that slows bone growth. Snap (SNAP) shares climbed 9% amid growing chatter that the U.S. could restrict — or ban — use of the TikTok app. Spirit Airlines (SAVE) shares tanked nearly 9% following reports that JetBlue Airways (JBLU) is bracing for turbulence from the Justice Department as it tries to block the airline's planned takeover of Spirit Airlines in the coming days, The Wall Street Journal reported. JetBlue shares finished up about 1%.

Investors cheered the company's quarter by sending shares up 13% on February 15, the stock's biggest one-day increase since Airbnb's December 2020 IPO. On February 16, the stock logged its highest close since May 2022. Even after giving back some post-earnings gains, Airbnb stock is up about 45% from a record low reached at the end of 2022. But the sentiment shift came as something of a surprise to hosts and managers using the home-booking platform who say they are finding it harder and harder to book guests. Ric Kenworthy, who manages 96 short-rental property listings through a company, Old Town Rental, in Arizona, was scrambling to fill unbooked units ahead of last month's Super Bowl in Glendale. ""We ended up at, let's just assume midday Saturday before the Super Bowl, close to 90% booked for all of our properties,"" Kenworthy told Yahoo Finance, later adding: ""Some key markets are experiencing quite a bit of saturation."" Kenworthy said he ended up cutting his listing prices by 50%: The going-rate for one of his rental properties went for $450-$600 a night that weekend after he'd been anticipating a rate closer to $1,000 a night given the demand generally created by an event like the Super Bowl. ""In 2022, we saw new heights in demand on the Airbnb platform and the result is continued growth in typical Host income, which was over $14,000 in the US,"" Sam Randall, a representative for Airbnb, told Yahoo Finance in a statement. ""We continue to invest in the success of our Host community and in the coming months will release new pricing tools to help them set competitive prices."" While some Airbnb hosts may not be feeling the full benefits, there is little doubt travel demand is back in full swing. Despite sticky inflation, consumers are booking trips: Data from a Bank of America Institute survey shows money spent on airline travel per household jumped 3.5% in January while international spending also increased compared to two years ago. ""I think the psychological impact of being locked down for some portion of the pandemic has only accelerated the trend that had already started,"" Marriott International (MAR) CEO Anthony Capuano told Yahoo Finance Live after the company's fourth-quarter earnings results showed the average room rates up 13% and revenue earned per average room jumping 29% year over year. Airbnb posted revenue of $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter, better than analyst expectations for revenues of $1.86 billion. The company's earnings per share also topped estimates, coming in at $0.48 cents against $0.08 forecasted. On the company's earnings call, CEO Brian Chesky told analysts Airbnb experienced ""tremendous growth"" in units listed online, ending 2022 with 6.6 million active listings. That was 16% higher compared to the previous year. Chesky attributed the increase in supply to two factors: demand and systematic improvements to their platform. As people flocked back to traveling, nights and experiences booked increased 20% in the fourth quarter, with active bookers in the fourth quarter reaching a record for the company. ""[Annual] revenue of $8.4 billion grew 40% year-over-year,"" Chesky said on the earnings call. ""And when you exclude foreign exchange, our revenue increased by 46% year-over-year."" The average daily rate for an Airbnb accommodation grew 36% compared to 2019 levels, according to CFO David Stephenson. He noted that it's generally ""more expensive"" to stay at an Airbnb than other accommodations and projected rates would come down ""modestly"" through the end of this year. ""We're not seeing any major shifts in overall kind of utilization rate that give us any concern,"" Stephenson said. ""We feel like we continue to keep, in aggregate, this nice balance of growing supply and growing demand, and we want to keep that relative balance."" Airbnb also stressed that the company is focused on three strategic priorities: raising awareness of hosting, upgrading core services, and scaling services beyond its core offerings. In late 2022, Airbnb added short-term sublet listings in an effort to grow its footprint among the multifamily market. The company asserted landlords and property managers using the sublet service could earn about 20% of the booking revenue. Airbnb also rolled out new categories, including one called ""OMG,"" which captures the most unique and exclusive accommodations. And after a Wall Street Journal report highlighted how some travelers were frustrated with host-mandated chore lists and the app's pricing format leading to sneaky costs, Airbnb launched a feature to show users price totals that include cleaning, service, and other fees. Looking ahead, some wonder about the sustainability of Airbnb's boom. “Can the top line demand persist? And then given their growth and supply, can the average rates [hold]?,” Nick Jones, research analyst at JMP Securities, told Yahoo Finance. ""If the demand wanes, that's going to increase available supply at any given day, which then... should result in lower prices, which then would impact their profitability."" Even if demand plateaus, the situation could change: January data from AirDNA suggested that rapid listing growth ""outpaced rising demand"" in 2022. ""U.S. short-term rentals earned over $62 billion ($141 billion globally) throughout the year (up 25.1% YoY), with almost 200 million nights stayed and over two million listings receiving at least one booking,"" AirDNA stated. ""Overall occupancy ended the year at 58.7%, a significant drop from the 61.3% in 2021."" In any case, as travel evolves after the pandemic bust and boom, some Airbnb hosts see a shift in consumer behavior. Michelle Burson, owner of a 4,000 square-foot Airbnb in Brookings, Oregon, is experiencing less foot traffic for her rental unit. ""Our bookings [have] declined last year compared to the previous year,"" Burson said. In Burson's view, ""one of the reasons was people were taking their traditional vacations…going to Hawaii, Europe, rather than driving, [or taking] road trips."" And Masha Löfstedt, who owns three rental properties in Oregon, struggled to get her property booked ahead of the holiday season. ""One of our houses that rents out all the time, nobody's booked for this weekend. That's like the first time in years,"" Löfstedt told Yahoo Finance in late 2022.

While I really enjoyed watching Salesforce and C3.ai shares explode higher post earnings last week, hot movers along these lines have been too few and far between (in either direction) in recent weeks. But if you take a step back and level set the stock market today, the muted action kind of makes a great deal of sense. Investors are facing a fresh dilemma — call it paralysis by analysis amid all the incoming data flying in. On the one hand, we have hot retail sales and inflation reports from the government — both calling into question whether the Federal Reserve is moving fast enough to squash inflation. On the other end of the spectrum, the jobs market continues to be solid (as probably seen in this week's jobs report). Yet, when you look at fourth quarter earnings (and conference calls) from Best Buy, Home Depot, Target and other retailers, you will see consumer weakness in big ticket merchandise. Dig into Target's earnings, and you will see a shopper trading down to cheaper private label goods because they are less inflationary and they just got laid off by a tech company. Taken together, this is a confusing time to be an investor – something market maven Keith Lerner at Truist captures in a new note he sent me: ""The recent action is very much aligned with a key market dilemma we have been highlighting: If the economy stays stronger, as we have seen recently, Fed policy is set to remain tighter, and this will weigh on market valuations. Or, instead, if the economy weakens, this will pressure profits. Neither of these outcomes are favorable for premium market valuations."" In other words, Mr. Market doesn't know what he wants! And if you think all the bad news of any kind is priced into stocks, Lerner adds these considerations: ""For perspective, the S&P 500’s forward P/E of 17.6x is still slightly above the 10-year average of 17.2x, and that’s in the context of a high degree of uncertainty around economic growth, inflation, and earnings. Forward earnings estimates are hovering near a 52- week low, and downside risks remain. The 1-year U.S. Treasury yield has jumped above 5% for the first time since 2007, and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which is hovering around 4%, is nearly double the average of the past decade.""

2023-03-04,msft,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/bankman-fried-flip-phone-limited-153437236.html,"By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sam Bankman-Fried should be allowed while on bail to have a flip phone with no internet capability and a basic laptop with limited functions, but be forbidden from using other electronic communication devices, the U.S. Department of Justice said. The proposal to limit the indicted FTX cryptocurrency exchange founder's communications was filed late on Friday in Manhattan federal court, on behalf of the government and Bankman-Fried's defense team. It requires approval by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who oversees the case. Kaplan had signaled at a Feb. 16 hearing that he might jail the 30-year-old Bankman-Fried for testing the limits of his $250 million bail package by communicating in ways that could not be monitored. The judge said he did not want to set Bankman-Fried ""loose in this garden of electronic devices,"" following accusations that Bankman-Fried tried to contact possible government witnesses and used a virtual private network to watch football. Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty after prosecutors said he stole billions of dollars of FTX customer funds to plug losses at his Alameda Research hedge fund. He faces 12 criminal charges under an indictment made public on Feb. 23. The proposed flip phone or other non-smartphone for Bankman-Fried would be limited to voice calls and SMS text messages. Laptop internet use would be restricted to specified virtual private networks, 23 websites for personal use including news, sports and food delivery, and websites to help Bankman-Fried prepare for his scheduled Oct. 2 trial. Bankman-Fried is living under house arrest with his parents, both Stanford Law School professors, in Palo Alto, California. The parents agreed to submit sworn affidavits that they would not bring other electronic devices into their home or let their son use theirs. They also agreed that each device would carry software that periodically takes videos or photos of the user, which court officers would be allowed to review, the letter said. Bankman-Fried's lawyers did not immediately respond on Saturday to requests for comment. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York and Anirudh Saligrama in Bengaluru; Editing by Daniel Wallis)"
2023-03-03,msft,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-march-3-2023-133941006.html,"U.S. stocks rallied on Friday, rounding out a big end to the week, while bond yields retreated slightly from their recent march. At the close, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) surged 1.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) increased 1.1%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 2%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note (^TNX) moved back and forth around the key 4% level Friday, eventually settling below the line, after services data showed economic activity expanded in February. Crude oil traded higher, with U.S. benchmark WTI (CL=F) up at $79.71 a barrel. On the economic data side, economic activity in the services sector grew in February for the second consecutive month as the ISM Services PMI came in at 55.1, slightly lower from 55.2 recorded in January and above economist expectations of 54.5. February's ISM Services figures ""suggests activity continues to expand at a reasonably healthy pace, but provides further reason to doubt the idea that there has been a resurgence in growth since the start of the year,"" Andrew Hunter, deputy chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note following the release. The moves come after the Federal Reserve published a semiannual Monetary Policy Report to Congress that details the central bank's plans to hike interest rates as a means to restore price stability. Officials indicated ""that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2% over time,"" the Fed said in its report. Stocks rallied on Thursday, with the S&P 500 trading lower for most of the session before rallying after commentary from Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic. Bostic said he’s still open to raising rates by another quarter percentage point at the central bank’s March meeting. “I let the data guide me,” Bostic told reporters in a press briefing. “If the data continue to come in suggesting the economy is stronger than I had projected, I’ll adjust my policy trajectory.” Bostic, who isn’t a voter on monetary policy this year, wrote an essay on Wednesday calling for the Fed to raise its policy rate by 50 basis points to a range of 5%-5.25% and then keep it there until well into 2024. Fed officials raised the benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point in February, pulling the target to stand in a range of 4.5%-4.75%. Policymakers will be releasing new projections after the central bank’s March 21-22 meeting. In single stock moves, C3.ai (AI) shares surged over 30% Friday after the company posted fiscal third quarter revenue that came at $66.7 million, beating analyst expectations of $64.2 million. Shares of Rivian (RIVN) jumped after the EV maker said on Friday it's keeping to the original production forecast of 50,000 vehicles in 2023. Costco (COST) shares sank 2% after the bulk retailer posted mixed results for the second quarter. Total revenue for its latest quarter was $55.27 billion, slightly below analysts' expectations of $55.58 billion. During the earnings call, the company provided some hopeful news on the inflation front. ChargePoint (CHPT) shares were down Friday after the maker of EV charging stations reported disappointing results and issued softer guidance. Shares of Amazon (AMZN) were up 3% as the company pauses construction on its second quarters in Arlington, Virginia. The move follows the tech giant's announcements of job cuts in the wake of slowing consumer and corporate spending. Marvell Technology (MRVL) stock fell after the company reported mixed results, with earnings in line with expectations but guidance weaker than forecasted. Shares of Meta Platforms (META) surged 6% as the company announced it would slash prices of its Quest Pro virtual-reality headset after the product launch. In the cryptocurrency market, both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) fell as customers pull their funds from crypto bank Silvergate (SI), whose stock plunged more than 57% during the trading session on Thursday. Following the drop in Bitcoin, the pullback is close to 10% and the digital asset was on pace to close below its 50-day moving average for the first time in almost two months, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-02,msft,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-today-march-2-2023-135533324.html,"Stocks rallied on Thursday with the Dow leading markets higher as results from Salesforce (CRM) lifted the index, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq shook off early losses to finish in the green. At the close on Thursday, the S&P 500 was up 0.76%, the Nasdaq higher by 0.73%, and the blue chip Dow up 1.05%. Rates remained a key focus for investors, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note settling north of 4%, its highest level since November. The rise in yields has come as investors brace for more aggressive action from the Federal Reserve in the coming months as inflation stays elevated and the economy remains strong. On the front end of the Treasury curve, the yield on 2-year notes continued to trade near its highest level since 2007. The 2-year yield, which stood near 4.8% on Thursday, is seen as the best proxy for investor expectations of the Fed's near-term path for interest rates. In single-stock moves, shares of Salesforce rose 11.5% on Thursday as investors cheered the company's latest quarterly report, which saw the embattled Dow member double down on cost-cutting initiatives and shareholder return plans. The stock's opening gap higher of 16% was its largest since Aug. 2020, according to data from Bloomberg. In an interview with Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi late Wednesday, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in reference to the company's efficiency initiatives: ""We have hit the hyper-space button."" The company announced in its quarterly report an increase in its share repurchase authorization to $20 billion, with COO Brian Millham telling investors on a call, ""We're inspecting every part of our business to find opportunities to drive efficiencies and reduce cost of sales, marketing, and G&A."" Salesforce's 11.5% jump, good for jsut over a $19 per share increase in the stock price, added roughly 110 points to the price-weighted Dow's 340 point gain on Thursday. Elsewhere in single-stock moves, shares of troubled bank Silvergate (SI) fell 57% on Thursday after the company delayed the filing of its annual report and said it would likely report losses larger than those previously disclosed. The bank took on several high-profile crypto clients in recent years and has seen its share price collapse by more than 90% in the wake of the failure of FTX, among other crypto bankruptcies. Tesla (TSLA) shares were also in focus on Thursday, falling 5.9% as the electric carmaker held its latest investor day on Wednesday, which revealed few new product details but emphasized the company's push to unlock new efficiencies in its manufacturing and design processes. On the economic data side, the weekly report on initial jobless claims showed 190,000 new filings for unemployment insurance were made last week, the latest sign the labor market remains robust. Though tomorrow marks the first Friday of the month, the February jobs report will not be released until March 10.

2023-03-02,msft,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/mortgage-rates-surge-closer-to-7-170022384.html,"Mortgage rates jumped higher this week, getting even closer to 7% and crushing homebuyer activity, which hit a 28-year low. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage increased to 6.65% from 6.50% the week prior, according to Freddie Mac. Rates have climbed over a half-point in February, reversing declines since mid-November. The spike in rates is another blow to would-be buyers, who are also facing still-high home prices and a shortage of affordable homes for sale. Sellers also appear to be pulling their listings, rather than cutting prices further to spur interest. “I think the biggest concern is buying into a market that would continue to go down,” Jeff Reynolds, broker at Compass and founder of UrbanCondoSpaces, recently told Yahoo Finance. “In my 18-year career, I have never seen rate moves like we are seeing now.” The volume of applications to purchase a home slid by 6% from one week earlier, the Mortgage Bankers Association’s survey of applications for the week ending Feb. 24 found. Overall, demand was 44% lower than the same week a year ago and has nosedived to a 28-year low. The drop in demand registered this past month is a sign that affordability remains a top concern, according to Redfin Deputy Chief Economist Taylor Marr. “The housing market took two steps forward in December and January, but has taken one step back in February,” Marr said in a statement. “Mortgage rates crept back this month, which is prompting more buyers and sellers to back off.” Another reason for the pullback in demand is rising home prices. The national median list price increased to $415,000 in February, Realtor.com data showed, up from $406,000 in January. While that’s down 7.6% from June’s peak of $449,000 – it still represents a yearly growth rate of 7.8%. That translates to out-of-pocket costs for buyers. According to Realtor.com, the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home is roughly $630 higher than a year ago. That puts the monthly mortgage payment 45.1% higher than a year ago, exceeding rent growth, up 2.9% from a year ago, and inflation, up 6.4%. As rates continue to climb, fewer home sellers are active this year. The number of newly-listed homes for sale declined by 15.9% in February compared with the previous year, Realtor.com data found. That’s a larger rate of decline versus January’s 10.4% decrease, but a small improvement from November and December. Overall, new listings remained 27% below pre-pandemic 2017 to 2019 levels. According to Redfin, existing homeowners don’t want to move because they don’t want to give up their ultra-low mortgage rates. As of February, approximately 85% of mortgage holders have a rate far below 6%. Homeowners may also be hesitant to put their homes on the market due to soft homebuyer demand that’s forcing sellers to cut prices. “We'll find out in the next 30 days if buyers are getting used to higher rates,” Reynolds said, “or if they will stay on the sideline waiting for rates to come back to earth.” Gabriella is a personal finance reporter at Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-02,msft,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/what-the-end-of-the-great-moderation-era-means-for-investors-morning-brief-103057491.html,"This article first appeared in the Morning Brief.

Subscribe Thursday, March 2, 2023 Today's newsletter is by Jared Blikre, a reporter focused on the markets on Yahoo Finance. Follow him on Twitter @SPYJared. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. In 2004, then-Fed chair Ben Bernanke gave a speech titled, ""The Great Moderation."" His thesis: ""One of the most striking features of the economic landscape over the past twenty years or so has been a substantial decline in macroeconomic volatility."" And while the Global Financial Crisis dented this belief, a post-crisis economic recovery and stock market boom brought these ideas back into vogue among many investors who rode a ""stocks only go up"" rally for more than a decade. But with inflation at multi-decade highs and interest rates at their highest levels in over 15 years, some investors are saying that the old investing epoch has come to an end — ushering in a new era where fundamentals matter, traditional savers are rewarded once again, and the volatility that Bernanke said goodbye to is back. In other words, choppier waters might be the new norm for a while. There are a few things that are starkly different about this present business cycle, Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, told Yahoo Finance Live Wednesday. First, there's the hot labor market, despite the white-collar layoffs. Historically, it's the lower-wage workers that are first in line to get cut. ""Yet another thing about this cycle that is just so different relative to past cycles,"" Saunders said. To date, this downturn has been felt mostly at the upper ends of the wealth spectrum, with asset prices like stocks, bonds, and real estate suffering declines. Meanwhile, inflation is a pernicious problem that disproportionately affects lower incomes. But it has not yet become entrenched — at least in the eyes of policy makers. Investors may not know what to think, but Sonders expects the current fog to lift a bit when we get the next batch of quarterly reports in April. But it might not be a clarity worth celebrating. Analysts have already been lowering the bar for the first quarter earnings, and Sonders believes they have a ways to go considering the bond market is signaling the Fed needs to be yet more aggressive. ""One of the factors most highly correlated to corporate earnings is the 10-year [U.S. Treasury] yield, with a lag,"" she says. Sonders believes the 10-year yield is forecasting the Fed will need to keep rates higher for longer, and that ""the path of least resistance for [earnings estimates] is down"" — targeting the first half of this year. Whether or not that near-term pain materializes, Sonders closes the door on the prior epoch of declining rates and volatility, then describes what investors can expect in the years to come. ""I think that the end of the Great Moderation era is very much here ... Gone are the days of cheap access to goods, cheap access to energy, [and] cheap access to labor. I think all three of those ships have sailed,"" she says. Sonders argues that reversing the engine of globalization and reorienting toward regionalism will have profound investing implications over the secular time frame. ""I would therefore expect greater inflation volatility, economic volatility, [and] geopolitical volatility. We're in this era of regionalization and demographic shifts that are pretty painful."" But as painful as these changes are for workers, consumers and investors alike, there are opportunities for investors. Consider that the Fed has finally raised short-term rates — the so-called risk-free rate — to levels that prevailed in decades prior. ""With the return of the risk-free [Treasury] rate, it's brought secular changes, including the fact that fundamentals are reattaching to prices,"" says Sonders. She goes on to explain that the market is no longer skewed so heavily toward mega cap stocks, and that there's hope for stock pickers once again after over a decade of underperformance. ""This has important implications and helps explain why equal-weighted [stock indices] have generally been doing better than [market] cap-weighted [indices] — why active [investing] has been doing better than passive [investing] — or at least is on a more level playing field with passive. And I think those are secular and as important backdrops for investors to think about.""

The bank said its team ""requires additional time to perform analysis, record journal entries related to subsequent events and to complete management’s evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting."" ""The Company is currently analyzing certain regulatory and other inquiries and investigations that are pending with respect to the Company,"" the company added. Silvergate shares have collapsed over the last year as the company's entanglements with several crypto firms — including bankrupt exchange FTX, among others — resulted in deposits falling by more than two-thirds in the fourth quarter of last year. In January, the company laid off 40% of its staff. The company later suspended a dividend paid on preferred shares as it sought to shore up cash. Over the last year, shares of the bank have lost more than 95%. A spokesperson for Silvergate told Yahoo Finance: ""Silvergate is working diligently to file its 10-K as soon as possible and has no further comment at this time."" In Wednesday's notice, the bank said it sold additional debt securities beyond what was previously anticipated in January and February and it expects to record further losses than what was previously disclosed. In January, the company disclosed it took $887 million worth of non-interest losses in the fourth quarter. The sales are primarily to repay ""outstanding advances"" it received from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, Silvergate said. The bank also needs additional time to complete an ""evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting"" being conducted by its third party accounting firm. Citing business and regulatory challenges, the company is weighing how much the changes might affect its ""ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements,"" according to the filing. In late January, a bi-partisan group of U.S. Senators pressed the company to provide answers over whether it was aware its clients FTX misused customer funds. A Reuters report in February said a Silvergate account controlled by Binance.US moved millions of dollars to a company controlled by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. Last week in a joint statement with the Federal Deposit and Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve made a point to highlight the heightened liquidity risks for banks taking on crypto-related clients. As for its own risks, Silvergate cited “heightened regulatory scrutiny of banking institutions that provide products and services to the digital asset industry,"" private litigation, and investigations from congressional inquiries, banking regulators and the Justice Department. Analysts at JPMorgan downgraded the stock to Underweight from Neutral and withdrew their its price target in a note out Thursday, calling the situation ""highly unusual"" and adding: ""The 'run' experienced at Silvergate appears to have been driven by a combination of (1) trust in the overall system being shaken given the collapse of previously trusted players (such as FTX) and (2) short-sellers voicing concerns (primarily on Twitter).""

The seasonally adjusted S&P Global US Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index was revised lower to 47.3 in February, up from 46.9 in January. The reading indicates ""a solid deterioration in the health of the goods-producing sector, despite the pace of decline softening to the slowest for three months."" Separately, economic activity in the manufacturing sector diminished in February for the fourth consecutive month following a 28-month period of growth, according to the Institute for Supply Management report on business. The data offered a mixed bag. Employment in manufacturing decreased to 49.10 in February from 50.60 in January. New orders rose to 47.0 compared to January's figure of 42.5. Prices paid jumped to 51.3 from January's reading of 44.5. Stocks fell Tuesday, rounding out the last day of a volatile month of February on Wall Street. According to JP Morgan’s trading desk, February’s month-end rebalance drove some weakness in equities and strength in bonds Tuesday afternoon. With February in the rearview, the S&P 500 remains up more than 3% this year, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group. Mega-caps have been a massive driver of the index moves. That said, 20 of the largest stocks in the S&P 500 have accounted for most of the index’s gains. Now, as the calendar turns, March historically sees the S&P 500’s gains in the second half of the month, Bespoke Investment Group noted. The path of the Federal Reserve's rate hikes remains in focus for investors. Two Federal Reserve officials spoke on Wednesday leaned in the move that aggressive interest rate hikes are the path forward to ease inflation. They followed Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, who said on Tuesday it would be a “danger and a mistake for policy makers to rely too heavily on market reactions” and emphasized the importance to “supplement these traditional data with observations on the ground from the real economy.” However, Goolsbee, who will be a voter at this year’s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting, didn’t comment on monetary policy. Since last year, the Fed has sharply raised rates in an effort to cool inflation. But inflation remains sticky. Policymakers will be releasing new projections after the central bank’s March 21-22 meeting. On the housing front, mortgage rates continue to move upward, pushing buyers to the sidelines as the spring housing market is underway. Both purchase and refinance applications slumped last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index. Volume of purchase applications hit a 28-year low, down 44% from a year ago.

2023-03-01,msft,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/goldman-sachs-tries-to-reset-firm-culture-after-three-unusual-years-171038235.html,"Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon addressed negative headlines surrounding the bank's culture during the company's second-ever investor day on Tuesday. ""I hate the noise,"" Solomon said bluntly. ""I live in the same neighborhood as you all live in and I wish the noise was different."" Various media reports of mass partner exits, coupled with recent Wall Street chatter the bank has lost its way after the failure of its consumer banking project Marcus, have all contributed to unfavorable sentiment. And this coming after the company laid off some 3,200 workers positions, or a little over 6% of its headcount, in January after a challenging 2022. Solomon admitted mistakes were made, telling investors: ""I think we’ve accomplished a lot over the past few years. We got some things right, got some things wrong."" ""I read things in the paper that don’t match what’s happening inside the firm,"" Solomon continued, explaining there were fewer partner transitions in 2022 than any other year going back to 2014. ""The culture of Goldman Sachs is incredibly strong. ...We have an extraordinary group of people working incredibly hard,"" he said. ""We also recognize we've gone through a very unusual period over last 3 years — the pandemic was a very tough thing on a culture like ours."" Goldman Sachs shares, down about 5% over the past month, are trading relatively flat year-to-date — underperforming the S&P 500's 3% gain over that same time period. Solomon went on to note Goldman is a ""human business,"" explaining the firm has made conscious decisions to invest in its culture with leadership spending more time with partners throughout the year to help push a greater sense of community throughout the organization. ""We’re going to continue to invest in our culture. I think it's very good, [but] I do think we've had dramatic shifts,"" he said, once again referencing the pandemic which was quickly followed by an unfavorable macro environment. ""That created more noise, more grumbling than usual."" Overall, ""I feel good about the partnerships [and] the culture, but that doesn't mean we don't have to keep investing,"" he reiterated. Goldman saw a rough end to 2022 with profits down a whopping 69% in Q4 amid a serious decline in deal-making revenues, pressured by a weakening economic backdrop. Following Tuesday's presentation, analyst reaction appeared cautiously optimistic, although questions remain over the path to profitability for its consumer banking unit, otherwise known as platform solutions. Shares of Goldman fell about 4% on Tuesday as the company made its pitch to investors. ""Coming out of the conference, the buzz among investors was whether GS will grow the consumer businesses or sell parts of them. Our interpretation of management's commentary is that both options are on the table,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck wrote in a new note published on Wednesday. Graseck maintained her Equal Weight rating and reiterated a 12-month price target of $332 a share. Graseck added all three business segments, which also includes investment banking and trading along with wealth and asset management, ""have an opportunity to contribute to Y/Y EPS growth as GS targets growth opportunities and gets more efficient."" Goldman reported a net loss of $660 million in its platform solutions unit in the fourth quarter with a full-year net loss settling at $1.67 billion. The company blamed the decline on higher provisions for credit losses, but stressed on Tuesday: ""Profitability is not a strategy. It is a priority and the outcome of a strategy well executed."" Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala told clients Wednesday Goldman's profitability push seemed genuine, writing: ""While investors looking for instant gratification may have been disappointed, we believe that management is on the same page with shareholders in that it appreciates the need to further shrink its consumer exposure ""unlock value"" (specifically, card partnerships and point-of-sale lending)."" Poonawala maintained a Buy rating and reiterated a $384 price target on the stock. Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-01,msft,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/feds-bostic-kashkari-call-for-higher-rates-after-concerning-inflation-jobs-data-150224928.html,"Two Federal Reserve officials speaking Wednesday said more aggressive interest rate hikes are likely necessary to slow inflation, as is the central bank keeping rates at elevated levels for some time. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said Wednesday he is remaining ""open-minded"" about whether the Fed should raise rates by 25 or 50 basis points at its next policy meeting on March 21-22. Markets currently expect a 25 basis point, or 0.25%, rate increase from the central bank. ""I’m open-minded about whether it's 25 or 50 basis points [at the next meeting],"" Kashkari said during a Q&A at a Sioux Falls Business CEO event. ""What's more important is what we signal in the dot plot."" The Fed will release a new set of economic forecasts and interest rate expectations alongside its March 22 policy statement. Kashkari said in December, he jotted down raising interest rates up to 5.4% and holding rates at that level for an extended period. ""At this point I haven't decided what my dot is, but I would lean towards continuing to raise further that I would continue to push up my policy path."" ""Given the data in the last month — higher inflation than we expected and a strong jobs report — these are concerning data points suggesting we're not making progress as quickly as we'd like,"" Kashkari said. ""At the same time shouldn't overreact to one month of data even if the data is troubling."" Kashkari is a voting member of the FOMC, the Fed committee that sets monetary policy, in 2023. Elsewhere, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said Wednesday he believes the Fed needs to raise its policy rate by 50 basis points, to a range of 5%-5.25%, and hold it at that level until well into 2024. ""We must determine when inflation is irrevocably moving lower,"" Bostic wrote in an essay published Wednesday. ""We're not there yet. That's why I think we need to raise the federal funds rate to between 5-5.25% and leave it there well into 2024. This will allow tighter policy to filter through the economy and ultimately bring aggregate supply and aggregate demand into better balance and thus lower inflation."" Bostic is not a voting member of the FOMC in 2023, but will be a voting member in 2024. Bostic said in order to consider reversing the course of monetary policy, he needs to see a better balance in the job market between labor supply and demand and see broad-based inflation narrow. Bostic noted about half of the goods in the CPI market basket still show inflation rates of 6% or higher. The Fed targets inflation that averages 2%. ""If we are going to get inflation back in the range of our target, the breadth of inflation will have to narrow considerably,"" Bostic wrote. ""When inflation is no longer top of mind, our mission will largely be accomplished. We are clearly not there yet. But I—and the Committee—are committed to doing all we can to ensure that we get there as soon as possible."" Both Bostic and Kashkari noted that while the increase in interest rates has slowed the housing and real estate sectors, they aren’t seeing many signs higher rates are really slowing down the rest of the economy. ""Business contacts tell us activity may well soften, but they don't anticipate a severe deterioration,"" Bostic wrote. ""When businesses think customers will buy less of their product or service in the near and medium term, then they will adjust hiring and investment plans accordingly."" Kashkari said the U.S is not in recession right now pointing to strong job growth, but said whether the Fed can avoid causing a recession with its interest rate hikes to fight inflation — a so-called soft-landing —remains an open question. ""The track record is not good at being able to slow down the economy this much without going a little too far and heading into recession,"" he said. ""[But] typically, when the central bank has caused a recession by raising interest rates, the bounce back can be very fast."" Kashkari said the dynamics in this economic cycle are different given families and states have strong balance sheets and supply chains are getting better. Both Fed officials said the cost of raising rates too much outweighs the costs of raising rates too little, adding the Fed must avoid a 1970s scenario in which the central bank cut rates too soon, causing inflation to re-surge and forcing the Volcker-led Fed to hike rates much higher to ultimately bring down inflation.

Follow him on Twitter @MylesUdland and on LinkedIn. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. U.S. consumers and the executives that Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon talks to have a lot in common — they feel good about today and worse about tomorrow. New data out from The Conference Board on Tuesday showed consumer confidence dipped in February, with the decline entirely driven by expectations. The Conference Board's index fell to 102.9 in February from 106 in January and 109 in December; December's reading was the highest since Sept. 2021. Underneath the surface of this decline, however, was another month where a strong labor market lifted consumers' current expectations while fears about the future loomed. ""The present situation index rose for a third straight month, underpinned by upbeat views on employment and business conditions,"" wrote Gurleen Chadha, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, in a note to clients on Tuesday. ""That index rose 1.7pts to 152.8. The differential between jobs 'plentiful' and jobs 'hard to get' rose to 41.5ppts, the highest since April 2022, indicating that current labor market conditions are still quite tight."" In January, the U.S. economy added a surprising 517,000 jobs while the unemployment rate stood at 3.4%. Meanwhile, speaking at Goldman's second-ever investor day on Tuesday, Solomon said the executives he spends his days speaking with are feeling better about a ""soft landing"" for the economy, but that inflation worries are ""hampering confidence."" ""When I talk to CEOs, they feel more uncertain about the course of inflation as we run through 2023, 2024. ...There's a real belief that inflation will be stickier and harder to moderate than markets now predict,"" Solomon said. The Conference Board's data shows consumers remain pleasantly surprised the soft labor market they'd braced for hasn't materialized just as executives fretting over recession remain similarly relieved. And yet both groups in their own way remain braced for some version of economic impact. It's just not clear that hasn't already happened. We're coming off a year in which the S&P 500 fell 19%, the price of gas in the U.S. hit $5 a gallon, and the inflation rate reached 9.1%. In less than a year, the Fed has raised interest rates 4.5%. The housing market got crushed. And the most popular investing strategy for those saving for retirement endured its worst year on record. All things that have improved in 2023. And if there's one theme that been pervasive in markets and the economy for some time now it's a sense from investors and consumers that the worst is yet to come. Economists at Wells Fargo said in a note consumer confidence data ""pours some cold water on the streak of strong economic data received to start the year."" Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, said Tuesday, ""if consumers drive the economy, the outlook for 2023 is bleak as the consumers expect that the worst is yet to come."" On Tuesday, The Conference Board's Expectations Index stood at 69.7, notable as any reading below 80 is typically consistent with recession, according to the report. This index, however, has been below 80 for 11 of the last 12 months. And we wait for the recession still. Solomon said there is typically a ""4 to 6 quarter lag before people reset their expectations."" The question, then, is in which direction do consumers and businesses need to reset expectations against those held today. And, once they do, will it already be too late?

2023-02-28,msft,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-february-28-2023-120603661.html,"U.S. stocks fell Tuesday, rounding out the last day of a volatile month of February on Wall Street. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) edged lower by 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined 0.7%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ticked down by 0.1%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked up to 3.92% Tuesday afternoon. The U.S. benchmark WTI crude oil moved higher to trade around $76.94 a barrel. The dollar index was up, trading at $104.92. Stocks closed higher on Monday, fueling a temporary rebound from Wall Street's worst week of the year. All three indexes ended February in the red after an optimistic start to the year in January. Economic data released on Tuesday showed that retail inventories, excluding auto, rose 0.3%, higher than 0.1% expected by economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Meanwhile, wholesale inventories declined 0.4%, below consensus estimates of 0.1%. American consumers felt worse about the economy in February, the Confidence Board reported. The board's Consumer Confidence Index slumped to 102.9 from 106.0, below consensus estimates of 108.5,  Meanwhile, February Chicago PMI dipped to 43.6 from 44.3, also below consensus expectations. “Consumers and businesses are looking for ways to reduce expenses in anticipation of much weaker activity over the rest of the year. The drop in consumer confidence in February aligns with weaker business confidence readings as the Fed’s sharp increase in interest rates start to bite,"" Ben Ayers, Nationwide senior economist, wrote in a statement. Other data showed that home prices fell 0.5% in December, according to data from S&P Corelogic Case-Shiller Index. On a yearly basis, home prices rose 4.6%, lower than analysts' expectations of 4.8%. As inflation still remains sticky, Federal Reserve Governor Philip Jefferson on Monday shot down arguments for raising the central bank’s 2% inflation target and said he is under ""no illusion"" that it's going to be easy to get the inflation rate back down. This week, investors will remain focused on the retail sector. On Tuesday, earnings from Target (TGT) topped analysts' expectations as consumer spending continues to move away from discretionary categories. The retailer’s same-store sales grew by 0.7%, above estimates of a 1.74% decline. The stock rose about 1% on Tuesday. Data from Bespoke Investment Group showed that over the last week, 420 stocks have reported earnings and the percentage of companies lowering guidance is more than double the percentage raising guidance, signaling ""lots of trouble for these smaller-cap companies that report late in the season."" In other single stock moves, Zoom (ZM) shares rose after the company posted better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings, with earnings per share of $1.22 higher than estimates of 80 cents. Revenue came in at $1.12 billion. Occidental Petroleum (OXY) shares moved down on Tuesday after the oil and gas producer posted fourth-quarter results that came in below Wall Street expectations on revenue and earnings per share. Shares of Workday (WDAY) were up after the human-resources software company topped expectations with revenue of $1.65 billion, up 20% year-over-year, against estimates of $1.63 billion. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (AMC) fell jumped on Tuesday after a Delaware court said it would hold a hearing on April 27, which will likely delay the date of conversion of convertible units APE to common stock. Tesla (TSLA) shares fell around 1% as Mexico's president confirmed that the EV maker will build a new plant in Monterrey, Mexico. The Mexican president said more details will be released at Tesla's investor day, and he said the plant is expected to be ""very big."" Shares of Coinbase (COIN) surged as fears of crypto regulation begin to fade. On Monday, the company was served a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission as the regulatory agency cracks down on cryptocurrency listings, its custody of digital assets and platform operations, and more, the company disclosed. Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) shares sank after the company reported a wider-than-expected loss and forecasted disappointing guidance for 2023 as the cruise operator gets squeezed by soaring fuel and labor costs. Separately, Bank of Nova Scotia shares dropped after the Canadian lender reported a missed in earnings estimates as a lull in its investment banking division dented income from its capital markets unit. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. Today the process opens for semiconductor companies to apply for a piece of the $39 billion grant money being allocated as part of the CHIPS and Science Act. But there's a catch: firms that win the funds may not be able to buy back stock – for a while, anyway. “We want to make sure that their money is being used to increase research and development in innovation and not to pad their bottom line or do buybacks,” said Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in an interview with Yahoo Finance. One could argue it’s the administration’s prerogative to decide how chipmakers that accept grants to build factories use that money. But the White House wants to go further, by boosting taxes on buybacks from their current 1%. In his State of the Union address earlier this month, President Joe Biden said that tax should be much higher: ""Corporations ought to do the right thing. That’s why I propose we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks and encourage long-term investments. They’ll still make considerable profit."" That proposal is what may have led Warren Buffett to weigh in on the hot-button issue in the Berkshire Hathaway CEO’s annual letter to investors: “When you are told that all repurchases are harmful to shareholders or to the country, or particularly beneficial to CEOs, you are listening to either an economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue (characters that are not mutually exclusive).” Even Buffett has a caveat, however: he says buybacks make sense only if they are made at “value-accretive prices,” i.e. when corporations don’t overpay. Taking a step back, corporations have a number of ways to spend their money, from building new plants to hiring people to research and development. They can also distribute the funds directly to shareholders by paying out dividends. Or they can repurchase shares, which has the effect of reducing overall share count, automatically increasing earnings per share. (In a simplified example, if a company makes $1 million in profit and has 50,000 shares outstanding, earnings per share are $20. If it buys back 10,000 of its shares, earnings per share go to $25, making an existing shareholder's stake more valuable.) And the numbers are a lot bigger than in the example above. Last year, U.S. companies announced a record $1.223 trillion of buybacks, according to data from EPFR TrimTabs. This year, it’s already running at $274.9 billion — heating up even after the 1% tax kicked in. Eliminating or restricting that tool, then, would be a big deal. Will it actually happen? In the case of companies accepting money as part of the CHIPS Act, it’s unclear whether they’ll be barred from doing buybacks at all, or just directly using the funding they’ve received. (Senator Elizabeth Warren and some of her colleagues in Congress want the participants to be barred from doing buybacks for 10 years). Secretary Raimondo said each case will be different, but the government will in theory have the ability to claw back money in the “most extreme cases” if companies do not comply with their agreements, whether that deals with buybacks or other stipulations. Investors in companies like Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) should take note, since they’re among the firms that have announced plans to build plants in the U.S. and are likely to apply for federal funding. As for whether a broader clampdown on buybacks is coming, policy analyst Ed Mills is skeptical. “Really, what this is about is setting up a strawman, as we get into debates about the debt ceiling,” Mills, a managing director at Raymond James, told Yahoo Finance in an interview. On the one hand, Republicans will fire up their rhetoric about getting the U.S. fiscal house in order. Democrats, led by President Biden, are likely to shoot back by saying Republicans aren’t willing to ask companies enacting big buybacks to pay more in taxes. “I don't think it happens, but I think it's going to be more part of the conversation than I think the market anticipates right now,” Mills said.

The Minneapolis-based retailer saw same-store sales increase by 0.7%, higher than Wall Street estimates of -1.74%. Similar to Walmart's (WMT) latest quarterly results, consumer spending at Target seemed to shift to essentials like food and away from categories like electronics, home, and apparel. Target shares jumped by more than 3.5% in pre-market trading after the report's release. Target CEO Brian Cornell said the team was pleased with the sales growth in what continues to be a ""very challenging environment."" Here's what Target reported, compared to Wall Street estimates, based on Bloomberg consensus data: Revenue: $31.40 billion versus $30.46 billion expected Adjusted earnings per share: $1.89 versus $1.48 expected Same-store sales: 0.7% versus -1.74% expected Brick & mortar same-store sales: up 1.9% versus -2.80% expected Cornell said having multiple category offerings, including food & beverage, in addition to beauty and household items served the retailer well this past quarter, Cornell said. ""Strength in Food & Beverage, Beauty and Household Essentials offset ongoing softness in discretionary categories. This performance highlights the benefit of our multi-category merchandise assortment, which drives relevance with our guests in any environment, and is a key reason we grew traffic every quarter last year."" Same-store sales beat estimates, up 0.7% compared to expectations of a decline of 1.74%. Same-store sales at physical locations also got a boost, up 1.9%, while digital sales dropped 3.6% in Q4. At the end of Q4, inventory was 3% lower than 2021. Meanwhile, in discretionary categories like electronics, home and apparel, inventory was nearly 13% lower than 2021, ""partially offset by higher inventory in frequency categories."" For full-year fiscal 2022 results, revenue grew by $3 billion, to $109 billion. Compared to 2019, revenue is up more than $30 billion. In the full-year, same-store sales increased 2.2%, while traffic was up 2.1%. Looking ahead to fiscal 2023, Cornell said the retailer is focused on it's long-term strategy and ""continued differentiation through affordability, assortment, ease and convenience"" as it competes with other retailers for consumers trading down. ""At the same time, we’re planning our business cautiously in the near term to ensure we remain agile and responsive to the current operating environment...as we plan for the year ahead, we will continue to make robust capital investments and pursue efficiency opportunities in support of our long-term growth."" For the first-quarter of 2023, the company expects a wide range for same-store sales, from a low-single digit decline to a low-single increase, and an operating income margin rate of 4-5%. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.50 to $1.90. For fiscal-year 2023, the company expects same-store sales to be the same, from low-single digit to a low-single increase, along with an operating income of more than $1 billion and adjusted EPS to range from $7.75 to $8.75. In the next 3 years, the company aims to move beyond its pre-pandemic operating income margin rate of 6%, and says it could possibly reach that goal as early as fiscal 2024, ""depending on the speed of recovery for the economy and consumer demand."" — Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-02-27,msft,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-february-27-2023-130555308.html,"U.S. stocks rose on Monday, fueling a rebound from Wall Street's worst week of the year. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose by 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.2%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased by 0.6%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked down to 3.93% Monday. On the economic data side, new orders for manufactured durable goods in January plunged to 4.5%, the biggest drop since April 2020, the Census Bureau reported. The drop was more pronounced than economist estimates of 4.0%. ""The manufacturing sector will remain under pressure in the months ahead, but the details of January's report of durable goods orders and shipments suggest factory activity started the year on a better note than the headline figure would suggest,"" Lydia Boussour, EY Parthenon senior economist, wrote in a statement following the release. Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors’ index of pending home sales climbed 8.1% to 82.5 in January, sharply higher from the projected rise of 1.0% by Bloomberg economists, according to data the group released on Monday. On a yearly basis, however, pending transactions plunged by nearly 24%. ""The increase in the Pending Home Sales Index confirms that the US housing market has improved, or better put, has somewhat stabilized over the last several months due to lower mortgage interest rates,"" Raymond James chief economist Eugenio Aleman wrote in statement to Yahoo Finance. ""However, the recent increase in mortgage rates is probably going to inflict some more pain on the US housing market going forward."" Stocks closed out their worst week of 2023 on Friday after the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge showed it unexpectedly accelerated in January and consumer spending jumped. The “core” Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index – which excludes volatile food and energy components – showed prices climbed 0.6% in January and 4.7% from last year. The Commerce Department also reported consumer spending rose 1.8% last month from December, the largest increase in nearly two years. The survey’s results renewed anxiety among investors that the Fed would continue its aggressive tightening campaign against inflation. The drop in optimism pressured the major indexes, as the Dow Jones dropped 3% for its fourth consecutive losing week, while the S&P 500 shed 2.7% in its worst week since early December and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.3%. Data compiled by 22V Research has found that rising interest rates have increased the correlation between growth and value stocks to the highest level since at least 2005. This week, investors will remain keen on the retail sector, with earnings from Target (TGT) on deck before market open on Tuesday after Walmart (WMT) warned of cautious profit guidance for the year ahead. Home improvement retail giant Home Depot (HD) also had disappointing guidance for fiscal 2023. Elsewhere on the earnings calendar are results from Costco (COST), Macy's (M), Dollar Tree (DLTR), and Kohl's (KSS) to feature the retail side. Meanwhile, the share of companies topping analysts' expectations in the fourth quarter has been low compared to history. Data from FactSet showed that 68% of S&P 500 companies reported fourth quarter earnings that beat expectations, down from the five-year average of 77% and the 10-year average of 73%. In single stock moves, Seagen Inc. (SGEN) shares jumped Monday morning after a report from The Wall Street Journal said Pfizer (PFE) is in early-stage talks to acquire the cancer drugmaker company in what could be a multi-billion dollar deal. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK-B) stock rose following CEO Warren Buffett’s annual letter to shareholders, which offered readers a glimpse into his views on share buybacks, taxes, corporate accounting, and his sense of optimism about the economy. Shares of fuboTV (FUBO) sank after the sports-focused streaming service issued disappointing guidance in its fourth-quarter earnings report on Monday and disclosed that it had sold stock at a deeply discounted price. Fisker (FSR) shares jumped Monday after the electric vehicle startup announced its deliveries for its first vehicle, the Ocean SUV, would be completed by spring. Shares of Union Pacific (UNP) climbed after the largest freight operator announced its plans to name a new chief executive following pressure from activists to oust Lance Fritz from the job. Bath & Body Works (BBWI) shares fell after the company said in a letter to shareholders that the looming proxy battle is based on ""misguided"" motivations and would be detrimental to shareholders. The board made the decision to not appoint former Third Point co-chief investment officer Munib Islam. Elsewhere, in cryptocurrency news, Coinbase (COIN) said in a tweet that it will soon suspend trading for Binance's stablecoin, Binance USD, on March 13 at or around noon ET. The move comes after Paxos Trust disclosed it will stop creating the Binance-branded stablecoin, citing regulatory pressure. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. Salesforce is facing a defining moment in its 24-year history. Growth is slowing. Analysts are worried fundamentals will get worse before they get better as companies curtail tech spending amid a sluggish global economy. A fresh round of layoffs at Salesforce have just been uncorked....at a company that has only known aggressive hiring. Employees are questioning leadership at the tech titan. Co-CEO Bret Taylor is no longer co-CEO of Salesforce — instead he's off to launch an AI startup the serial entrepreneur tells me. Slack founder Stewart Butterfield, who stayed on when the company was acquired by Salesforce, is still founder...but no longer with the parent company. Salesforce co-founder Marc Benioff is back at the CEO helm, after attempting again to pullback from day to day duties (by delegating to a co-CEO) and focus more on his vast philanthropic ventures. To top it all off the company is staring down the barrel of five sharks in the field of activist money management: Elliott Management, Starboard Value, Inclusive Capital, ValueAct, and Third Point. This is an unprecedented activist versus public company battle, pros have told Yahoo Finance. How it ends is wildly unclear, but is a situation just as important as Wednesday's earnings report. ""While the involvement of five activist investors has likely been the primary driver of CRM stock of late, quarterly results probably still matter (though not as much as usual), and how those results are delivered may be more relevant than ever,"" said Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci. Below, Yahoo Finance breaks down this complicated situation at large-cap tech name Salesforce. The drama is high, and it could all be coming down to one final epic conclusion. What Yahoo Finance Is Watching: Salesforce Earnings What sources tell us is top of mind on the Street: How quickly are sales deteriorating inside of the broader tech pullback? What does the pipeline of future business look like? Does Marc Benioff acknowledge the activist situation? Are more layoffs needed? Consensus is that Salesforce warns on sales and earnings for 2023 – but how bad is it? The Vibe Among Wall Street Analysts Analysts are generally expecting a muted tone from Salesforce on earnings day. “For Benioff and Salesforce the actual quarter and FY24 take a back seat to the fluid activist situation which is happening at Salesforce with the Street's patience wearing thin after a head scratcher Slack deal and slowing growth/underachieving margins front and center.” -Wedbush analyst Dan Ives ""Key to the Q4 call is gaining clarity on the extent to which management will turn the dial up on non-GAAP operating margins, GAAP profitability, and any future share repurchases with the emergence of activist involvement in the stock."" -Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss What the Activists Want From Salesforce Sources tell Yahoo Finance that Starboard Value — led by veteran activist investor and Papa John's chairman Jeff Smith — has been disappointed in Salesforce’s expense management, but isn’t advocating for a sale of Slack. Other activists involved in the situation are keen to see a Slack sale even at a low price as a show of faith by management they will improve margins, sources say. Overall, we are told the activists are entrenched and want clear changes from Salesforce leadership. Key thing the activist pool wants: Higher profit margins Realistic 2023 guidance Clear succession plan from CEO co-founder Marc Benioff Like we said, this earnings report is a defining moment in the history of Salesforce.

2023-02-26,msft,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stocks-under-pressure-retail-earnings-continue-what-to-know-this-week-142308388.html,"The 2023 stock market rally is under pressure. Inflation data last week that topped expectations — as well as a continued drop in optimism the Federal Reserve's rate hikes will end sooner rather than later — pressured the major indexes with the Dow logging a fourth-straight losing week and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq suffering their worst weeks of the year, losing 2.7% and 3.4%, respectively. The Dow endured its worst weekly performance since Sept. 2022. In the week ahead, investors will remain keyed in on the retail sector, with results from Target (TGT) in focus after rival Walmart (WMT) issued a warning on the state of U.S. consumers last week. On the economic data side, a crowded calendar of reports from the housing and manufacturing sectors — two areas of the economy which have most reflected the impact of policy tightening — is on tap along with a key measure of consumer confidence. On Friday, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index — the Fed's preferred assessment of how quickly prices are rising across the economy — showed prices rose 0.6% during the month of January and 5.4% over last year. On a ""core"" basis, which strips out volatile food and energy components, prices rose 0.6% for the month and at an annual clip of 4.7%. The week marked a turning point in sentiment around inflation expectations and the path forward for interest rates. The hotter-than-expected PCE index followed upside surprises to inflation this year from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and producer prices, which showed the largest increases in several months to start the year. ""The bear market rally that began in October from reasonable prices and low expectations has morphed into a speculative frenzy based on a Fed pause/pivot that isn't coming,"" Morgan Stanley's top strategist Mike Wilson said in a note to clients last week. Wilson's forecast sees the S&P 500 bottoming out at 3,000 this year. On Friday, the benchmark U.S. equity index closed at 3,970. ""Investor optimism had already been hit by a slow puncture this week but it's deflating more rapidly as the latest data indicates that the work in taming inflation is far from over,"" Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in a note. Standout economic data releases in the week ahead include the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index, ISM's manufacturing PMI, and The Conference Board's consumer confidence reading for February. On the corporate side, Target will release its fourth-quarter earnings results before market open on Tuesday with results from Costco (COST), Macy's (M), Dollar Tree (DLTR), and Kohl's (KSS) also featuring on the retail side. Last week, Walmart's CFO John David Rainey said the ""consumer is still very pressured, and if you look at economic indicators, balance sheets are running thinner and savings rates are declining relative to previous periods."" ""We expect Target's results will look similar to Walmart's, with better-than-expected sales, more gross margin pressure than predicted, and solid opex leverage in the store,"" Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe said in a note. Tarlowe warned, however, Target is not ""immune to consumer spending trends shifting to the more needs-based items and away from higher-priced and higher-margin discretionary categories."" Elsewhere on the earnings calendar, notable reports include Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Zoom Video (ZM), AMC Entertainment (AMC), Rivian Automotive (RIVN), and Dell (DELL) among others. — Monday: Durable Goods Orders, January Preliminary (-3.8% expected, 5.6% during prior month); Durables Excluding Transportation, January Preliminary (0.1% expected, -0.2% during prior month); Non-defense Capital Goods Orders Excluding Aircraft, January Preliminary (0.0% expected, -0.1% during prior month); Non-defense Capital Goods Shipments Excluding Aircraft, January Preliminary (-0.6% during prior month); Pending Home Sales, month-over-month, January (1.0% expected, 2.5% during prior month); Pending Home Sales NSA, year-over-year, January (-34.3% during prior month); Dallas Fed Manufacturing Activity, February (-9.10 expected, -8.4 during prior month) Tuesday: Advance Goods Trade Balance, January (-$91.0 billion expected, -$90.3 billion during prior month, revised to -$89.7 billion); Wholesale Inventories, month-over-month, January Preliminary (0.1% expected, 0.1% during previous month); Retail Inventories, month-over-month, January (0.5% during prior month); House Price Purchase Index, quarter-over-quarter, Q4 (0.1% during prior quarter); FHFA Housing Pricing Index, December (-0.1% during prior month); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City Composite, month-over-month, December (-0.54% during prior month); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City Composite, year-over-year, December (6.77% during prior month); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, year-over-year, December (7.69% during prior month); MNI Chicago PMI, February (44.3 during prior month); Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index, February (-11 during prior month); Conference Board Consumer Confidence, February (108.5 expected, 107.1 during prior month); Richmond Fed Business Conditions, February (-10 during prior month); Dallas Fed Services Activity, February (-15.0 during prior month) Wednesday: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Feb. 24 (-13.3% during prior week); S&P Global U.S. Manufacturing PMI, February Final (47.8 prior); Construction Spending, month-over-month, January (0.4% expected, -0.4% during prior month); ISM Manufacturing, February (47.9 expected, 47.4 during prior month); ISM Prices Paid, February (44.5 during prior month); ISM Employment, February (50.6 during prior month); ISM New Orders, February (42.5 during prior month); Wards Total Vehicle Sales, February (15.00 million, 15.74 million during prior month) Thursday: Unit Labor Costs, Q4 Final (2.5% expected, 3.0% during prior quarter); Nonfarm Productivity, Q4 Final (1.5% expected, 1.1% during prior quarter); Initial Jobless Claims, week ended Feb. 24 (TK expected, 192,000 during prior week); Continuing Claims, week ended Feb. 18 (1.654 million during prior week) Friday: S&P Global U.S. Services PMI, February Final (50.5 during prior month); S&P Global U.S. Services Composite PMI, February Final (50.2 during prior month); ISM Services Index, February (54.5 expected, 55.2 during prior month) — Monday: Groupon (GRPN), LendingTree (TREE), Li Auto (LI), Lordstown Motors (RIDE), Oak Street Health (OSH), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Workday (WDAY), Zoom Video (ZM) Tuesday: AMC Entertainment (AMC), AutoZone (AZO), Cracker Barrel (CBRL), Compass (COMP), Duolingo (DUOL), GoodRx (GDRX), HP (HP), J.M.

2023-02-24,msft,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-today-february-24-2023-104349492.html,"U.S. stocks tumbled Friday after the Federal Reserve's most closely watched inflation measure came in stronger than expected, in another sign that price pressures have become sticky into 2023. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) sank 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) plopped more than 300 points, or 1%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid 1.7%. Friday marked the worst week for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq since December. U.S. Treasury yields scrambled higher following the reading. The 2-year note surged 12 basis points to 4.81% while the 10-year note gained 7 basis points to top 3.95%. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index — the Fed's preferred assessment of how quickly prices are rising across the economy — rose 0.6% in January and 5.4% from last year. On a ""core"" basis, which strips out volatile food and energy components, prices rose 0.6% for the month and 4.7% from last year. The report from the Commerce Department also showed that consumer spending rose 1.8% last month from December after falling the previous month. The numbers support recent indications inflation is not falling at the pace and extent investors have been hoping for, even as prices have stabilized from the peaks of the current inflation cycle. “First December CPI was revised higher, and now each reading for January surprised to the upside. Inflation’s like an old boyfriend or girlfriend that keeps showing up when you don’t want to see them,"" David Russell, Vice President of Market Intelligence at TradeStation said in a note. In individual stock moves, Block (SQ) rose 4.3% after the payments processor reported fourth-quarter financial results that saw profit and revenue top expectations. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) shares fell 1% after the media giant posted a big revenue loss for the final three months of the year. Boeing (BA) shares closed down 4.8% after the airline manufacturer said it paused deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner jets because of a documentation issue. Beyond Meat's (BYND) stock rallied 10% after better-than-expected earnings and CEO Ethan Brown said the company is seeing progress in its efforts to cut costs and manufacturing hurdles. Beleaguered used car retailer (CVNA) plunged 20.5% after reporting a net loss that was nine times wider in the fourth quarter. The bumpier-than-anticipated road to restoring price stability and strong economic data to start the year — nonfarm payrolls rose by 517,000 in January while retail sales surged 3% — have prompted investors to readjust expectations around the path forward for interest rates, putting a dent in the market's recent momentum. The S&P 500 snapped a four-day losing streak on Thursday as stocks closed higher. But earlier this week on Tuesday, stocks had their worst day of the year. ""Equity bulls and even Chair Powell have bragged about anchored expectations for inflation and how consumers and investors believe it is moving in the right direction,"" Morgan Stanley Chief Investment Officer Lisa Shalett said in a note earlier this week, noting that January's Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) raised questions about whether inflation progress is stalling. ""Given data crosscurrents, the central bank needs to tread carefully. Investors still wagering on a 'Fed put; or quick return to financial repression are apt to be wrong this time,"" Shalett said. ""Fed credibility is on the line, and it is likely to risk overshooting rather than quitting the inflation fight too early."" — Alexandra Semenova is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-02-24,msft,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/fed-inflation-fight-longer-pce-index-173353572.html,"Two Federal Reserve officials suggested Friday morning that inflation could persist longer than thought after the central bank's most closely watched inflation gauge surged by the most in months. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Fed Governor Philip Jefferson said they remain concerned about an inflation rate that remains well above the Fed's 2% year-over-year target. Mester reiterated that while inflation has moderated, the overall level remains too high. She noted recent research from the Cleveland Fed and a discussion paper that have suggested inflation could be more persistent than currently anticipated. “I see the risks to the inflation forecast as tilted to the upside and the costs of continued high inflation as being significant,” Mester said at the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum in New York. “So in my view, at this point, with the labor market still strong, the costs of undershooting on policy or prematurely loosening policy still outweigh the costs of overshooting.” The comments came as the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation – the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index – unexpectedly accelerated in January, rising 5.4% last month on an annual basis. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the inflation gage rose 4.7%, both marking pickups after several months of declines. On a monthly basis, the PCE index rose 0.6% in January compared with December. Core prices also rose 0.6% in January from the prior month, compared with December’s 0.4% increase. The numbers Friday came a week after the government released the Consumer Price Index, which showed a similar pickup in the inflation rate. The hot read on inflation hit markets on renewed rate hike fears, with the Dow Jones Industrial average tanking 336 points. ""By betting on a terminal rate above 5.35%, the market is effectively betting that the recent momentum in both growth and inflation will be sustained through the summer,"" Jefferies chief economist Aneta Markowska said. Mester, who does not vote on monetary policy decisions this year, told Bloomberg in an interview Friday morning that the latest inflation reading shows the Fed needs to keep raising interest rates but stopped short of suggesting it required a 50-basis-point rate hike at the next policy meeting in March. Mester said last week she wanted to raise the benchmark policy rate by 50 basis points at the last policy meeting to try to get to the peak rate faster, though she also didn't want to surprise markets. In a separate interview Friday morning with CNBC, Mester signaled her forecast in December to raise rates a bit above 5% hasn’t changed much. Speaking at the same Monetary Policy Forum on Friday, Boston Fed President Susan Collins said inflation is still too high and that the Fed has more work to do. “Inflation remains too high, and recent data …all reinforce my view that we have more work to do, to bring inflation down to the 2 percent target,” said Collins. “I anticipate further rate increases to reach a sufficiently restrictive level, then holding there for some, perhaps extended, time.” Also speaking at the conference, Jefferson said a limited supply of workers for jobs needed, which has pushed up wages, suggests inflation may cool slowly. “The ongoing imbalance between the supply and demand for labor, combined with the large share of labor costs in the services sector, suggests that high inflation may come down only slowly,” he said. Jefferson also said the forces driving inflation now are different that past inflationary episodes and therefore economic models won’t be as helpful to policymakers. Jefferson said the current situation is different because the pandemic created unprecedented disruptions to global supply chains and is having a long-lasting impact on the labor participation rate. “The inflationary forces impinging on the U.S. economy at present represent a complex mixture of temporary and more long-lasting elements that defy simple, parsimonious explanation,” he said. Jefferson says he thinks the Fed is addressing the spike in inflation proactively, unlike in the 1970s and has more credibility now.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. What's old may be new again for U.S. stock investors. The end of zero-interest rate policies (ZIRP) is likely to mark a shift in equity market favorites from long-leading technology names to sectors like energy, materials and housing — or what strategists at Bank of America deem part of ""the old economy."" ""Bear markets have historically resulted in leadership change, which suggests old economy sectors are likely the winners of this cycle,"" Savita Subramanian, BofA’s head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy said in a note earlier this week. With these components of the market depleted of capital over the past ten years as Big Tech was powered by free money, the ""pendulum is expected to swing back"" in their direction, Subramanian noted. Despite the big gains across January in these very stocks that were battered throughout 2022, investors have called the moves higher this year a bear market rally rather than the start of a new bull market. ""I think the stock market is in a protracted bear market,"" DoubleLine Capital founder and CEO Jeffrey Gundlach told Yahoo Finance Live in an interview Wednesday (video above), adding it began in the fourth quarter of 2021. ""[It's] very negative for the stock market when you have rising interest rates against these valuations, especially real interest rates,"" Gundlach said, adding a pause in the increase in real rates this fall was a catalyst for the recovery in risk assets. ""But it looks like real interest rates might start rising again."" Meanwhile on Sunday, Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson told clients in a not that the recent rally was ""a speculative frenzy"" based on false hopes for a pivot by the Federal Reserve. Equity markets are in the throes of a recent shift in the narrative for where interest rates will go, finally taking Fed officials at face value as they vow to lift their policy rate above 5% this year. Bank of America indicated its analysis of equity risk premium shows growth stocks were not pricing in recession risk and the expected higher-for-longer rate environment is projected to pressure long-duration growth stocks. Whatever the rest of the year holds for the U.S. stock market, signs have already emerged of an imminent change in leadership. Last year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average crushed the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite, for example, falling less than 10% in 2022 while the latter index wiped out more than one third of its value. As Yahoo Finance’s Jared Blikre pointed out, the Dow’s outperformance relative to the tech index was by far the biggest gap since the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. Goldman Sachs’s chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin warned in November that the ""exceptionalism of technology is arguably behind us. In 2022, the aggregate market capitalization of the current ""tetrad of largest stocks,"" as Goldman Sachs put it — Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) – fell to 18% from 22% the prior year. And those top four stocks lost an aggregate -25% compared to -13% for the remaining stocks in the index during the period. ""With the end of ZIRP, we see the pendulum swinging back to the old economy as prolonged underinvestment has led to supply issues in the old economy,"" Subramanian said. Bank of America itself raised metals to overweight, and is overweight energy, a testament to its confidence in the leadership transition.

2023-03-10,msft,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/microsoft-msft-considered-good-investment-143002474.html,"When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important? Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Microsoft (MSFT) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage. Microsoft currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.48, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 29 brokerage firms.

Generative AI, which has captured the attention of the tech industry, is a technology that can generate images, text or video in response to a prompt. Startups like OpenAI and tech giants like Microsoft and Google have introduced or announced AI chatbots that can synthesize web information to answer complex searches or even write original novels. ""We're seeing one of the most exciting moments in technology emerging,"" Jason Citron, chief executive of San Francisco-based Discord, said during a press briefing. Discord, which lets groups of users chat by text, video and voice, said it will revamp a bot called Clyde, who will now be powered by OpenAI technology. Discord users can invoke the AI-powered Clyde to answer trivia questions, help schedule meetings or recommend playlists, the company said. Another AI feature will let users ""remix"" their friends' avatars using generative image models. For instance, the feature could place a crown on a person's head in their profile image to celebrate their birthday. If users have been away from Discord and missed a stream of messages, an AI tool will be able to summarize the conversation and allow users to quickly jump back to parts of the message thread to catch up on the discussion. The tool will begin to roll out next week in a limited number of Discord groups, the company said. Discord said it will also experiment with OpenAI technology to improve an existing content moderation tool that helps automatically block harmful or unwanted messages from a Discord chat. The revamped tool can flag messages to moderators and also understand the context of the conversation, the company said. (Reporting by Sheila Dang in Dallas; Editing by Marguerita Choy)"

SVB stock plummeted 68% during Friday's premarket trading session before the halt after dropping more than 60% through Thursday, closing at $106 per share. CNBC's David Faber reported early Friday SVB's planned capital raise announced earlier this week had not cleared the market, and that the firm was now seeking to sell itself. Turmoil for SVB began when the California based bank filed a surprise announcement of a $1.8 billion loss following a deposit outflow and plans to raise $2.25 billion by selling common and preferred stock. Silicon Valley Bank primarily serves startups and technology firms, which have been under pressure as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.  Silicon Valley’s CEO Greg Becker urged calm with venture capitalists Thursday in a call, according to The Information, and asked them not to withdraw money. Bloomberg reported that venture capitalists have urged portfolio companies to trim their exposure to the lender. Another California bank that serves cryptocurrency clients, Silvergate Capital, announced a “voluntary liquidation” Wednesday, the same day Silicon Valley Bank announced its ill-fated capital raise. Shares were also halted in Signature Bank (SBNY), a New York institution that serves some cryptocurrency clients, after its shares dropped more than 16%. First Republic Bank (FRC), which serves some companies in the venture world and also targets high-net worth clients from the tech industry, saw shares fall as much as 40% early Friday. Concerns about risks to other banks spread on Thursday as stocks of giant financial institutions tumbled. A major bank index fell by the most Thursday in nearly three years. Shares for JP Morgan Chase (JPM) fell 5.41% Thursday and shares were roughly flat during Friday's open. Shares of Bank of America (BAC) fell 6.20% Thursday and opened Friday down more than 2%. Citigroup (C) shares fell 4.20% Thursday and opened Friday down more than 1%. Shares of Goldman Sachs Group (GS) fell 7.20% Thursday and an additional 2% Friday. In a Friday morning note, Morgan Stanley analysts said they don’t anticipate this SVB Financial’s challenges will cripple other regional banks. “The funding pressures facing SIVB are highly idiosyncratic and should not be viewed as a read-across to other regional banks,” according to the note. “We do not believe there is a liquidity crunch facing the banking industry, and most banks in our coverage have ample access to liquidity.” David Hollerith is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Futures tied to the S&P 500 (^GSPC) were down 0.2% ahead of the open, while futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined 0.3%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) edged up by 0.1%. January’s job report blew past expectations, as the U.S. economy added more than half a million jobs and the unemployment rate dipped to 3.4%, a level not seen since 1969. But economists aren’t expecting another surprise for Friday’s February jobs print. Consensus estimates from economists are for job gains of 225,000, a slower pace from the January’s blowout number. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.4%. “Signs of slowing outnumber signs of strength, making the chance that last month was a fluke likely,” Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, wrote in a note Friday morning. “At the same time, labor demand continues strong, which suggests a significant drop is also unlikely. A return to the previous trend makes the most sense.” The Federal Reserve has been keeping a close eye on all fronts to the labor market as the central bank tries to cool down inflation. The Friday’s jobs print will show whether January’s hiring gain was an outlier or the start of economic acceleration. Another key point of focus will be wage growth — and whether or not the trend accelerated last month. Meanwhile, other recent data continues to show the economy remains resilient. Consumer spending surged in January, inflation stayed sticky, and business activity expanded in February. The accumulation of economic data, coupled with comments this week from Chair Jerome Powell, has sparked the debate on whether a 0.25% or 0.50% rate hike from the Fed is likely for its March meeting. However, recent events in the banking world have spurred other concerns for Fed officials as their monetary tightening policy induces stresses into the banking system. A major tech firm lender revealed it’s in deep trouble. Silicon Valley Bank’s (SIVB) share price tanked 60% on Thursday, wiping out $9.6 billion of market value after announcing it needs to raise $2.25 billion to offset a $1.8 billion loss on some bond sales. The sour sentiment has spread across markets as the KBW Bank index (^BKX) was down over 7%, while index members including Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) edged lower Friday morning in premarket trading. Elsewhere, in the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin (BTC) crumbled below $20,000 Friday amid liquidation of Silvergate Capital (SI) and regulatory pressures on the industry. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Economists expect nonfarm payrolls grew by 225,000 last month with the unemployment rate expected to hold steady at 3.4%, according to data from Bloomberg. The BLS will release its latest jobs figures at 8:30 a.m. ET. Here are the key figures investors will be looking for in Friday's report compared to January's figures, according to data from Bloomberg: Nonfarm payrolls: +225,000 vs. +517,000 Unemployment rate: 3.4% vs. 3.4% Average hourly earnings, month-on-month: +0.3% vs. +0.3% Average hourly earnings, year-on-year: +4.7% vs. +4.4% Labor force participation rate: 62.4% vs. 62.4% Average weekly hours worked: 34.6 vs. 34.7 Investors will be paying particularly close attention to revisions to January's data released Friday morning, as investors saw the unexpectedly strong 517,000 jobs created to start the year as a potential outgrowth of seasonal adjustment factors or favorable weather. ""Given the potential impact of weather and seasonality effects in January there is the possibility of another shock last month, albeit mainly to the downside this time,"" wrote Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients earlier this month. Ashworth expects job gains in February will tally 200,000 just below consensus estimates. Friday's report also comes less than two weeks before the Federal Reserve's next policy meeting, with markets now expecting the central bank will raise interest rates by a more aggressive 0.50%. Fed Chair Jay Powell told lawmakers this week ""the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated."" Data from the CME Group shows markets pricing in an 60% of a 0.50% rate hike on March 22. An employment report that is in-line with expectations could clinch that more aggressive move later this month.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. For the last year, the Federal Reserve has tried to accomplish one goal, using one tool — lower inflation by raising interest rates. The result has been benchmark interest rates rising by 4.5% in a year and headline inflation falling from a peak of 9.1% in June to 6.4% as of January. As Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated in testimony on Capitol Hill this week, there is still work to be done for the Fed to achieve its goal. But over the last week, acute challenges at two banks have surfaced another issue now facing the Powell Fed. And that is the stability of the financial system. On Wednesday, Silvergate Capital (SI), which had become one of the crypto industry's biggest banking partners, announced it will liquidate and wind down operations after suffering significant deposit outflows from its digital asset clients. That same day, Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB), the preferred banking partner of the venture and startup worlds, announced it would take a $1.8 billion loss while liquidating its entire short-term securities book and raising $2.25 billion fresh capital. In a letter to investors, CEO Greg Becker assured investors the bank had ""ample liquidity,"" and said it took these actions ""because we expect continued higher interest rates, pressured public and private markets, and elevated cash burn levels from our clients as they invest in their businesses."" The Information reported Thursday afternoon Becker told investors on a call, ""I would ask everyone to stay calm and to support us just like we supported you during the challenging times."" Few statements have a tougher audience than investors being told to remain calm in times of market stress. On Thursday, U.S. stocks got crushed during a steady, relentless sell-off that centered on the financial sector. Regional banks were hammered. Big banks were hammered. The S&P 500 fell 1.8%. Bitcoin fell 7%. The challenge for Powell, however, is that some of the stress facing Silicon Valley Bank has been induced by the Fed's actions to fight inflation. And the fear is they may not be alone. In the simplest terms, Silicon Valley Bank took a nearly $2 billion hit selling bonds at a loss to buy different bonds that offer a higher yield. The firm's latest annual report showed the bank owned about $14 billion in Treasury securities with an average maturity between 1-5 years. Today, 1-year Treasury bills yield 5.25%. One day's drop in the stock market, of course, is not cause for concern about the financial system. Even the liquidation of one bank and deep investor concerns about another need not constitute a Fed-level worry about the U.S. banking system. But these moves serve as reminders that while the central bank's role in raising or lowering interest rates has become the focal point of investor attention over the last decade, the Fed also serves the central role in stabilizing markets and quelling investor fears during uncertain moments like the present. Almost exactly three years ago, Powell held an emergency Sunday night call on March 15, 2020 to announce a series of measures aimed at supporting the economy as the pandemic rapidly shut down global business. On that call, Powell reminded the assembled press, ""[That] central banks were originally designed to ...provide liquidity to financial systems in stress, so we take that job very seriously. It's probably the most important thing we're doing now is that."" Rising anxiety in the banking system as the ripples from a crypto collapse in 2022 and the icing over of a red hot venture market pale in comparison to the financial emergency the Fed faced three years ago. But their actions then were a reminder of the central bank's power, and, indeed, its centrality to financial markets. When the February jobs report is released Friday morning, investors will pore over the data to decipher whether a 0.25% or 0.50% rate hike from the Fed is likely warranted on March 22. This is the moment markets have been building towards for weeks. But the unforeseen stress now being injected into the banking system makes Friday and the days ahead notable for the Fed in an entirely different manner. That presents to Jay Powell another wrinkle in the challenge of trying to bring order to an economy that busted and boomed in a few short months.

2023-03-10,GC=F,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/why-silicon-valley-banks-crisis-is-rattling-americas-biggest-banks-121159393.html,"The problems of two small banks on the West Coast are rippling across markets and causing new investor concerns about some of the country’s largest financial institutions. Why? Three words: rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve’s aggressive campaign to bring down inflation helped set the stage for major problems at two California lending institutions — SVB Financial (SIVB) and Silvergate Capital (SI) — as an outflow of deposits forced both to sell assets at a loss. Those assets were bonds. Banks are big investors in assets like Treasury bills because they need lots of safe places to park their cash. Many financial institutions piled into these investments during a period of historically-low interest rates that spanned the early years of the pandemic, as banks took in tons of new deposits and lending was somewhat restrained. But now the Fed is hiking rates at a rapid clip, with Fed Chair Jay Powell warning earlier this week the central bank may have to speed up the pace of its rate increases to cool the economy further. The problem that creates for banks is simple: higher rates lower the value of their existing bonds. The withdrawals at SVB's Silicon Valley Bank have come from startups and technology firms, many of which also ran into new trouble once the Fed began raising rates. The deposit outflow forced SVB to sell assets and take a $1.8 billion loss, a move the bank it made “because we expect continued higher interest rates, pressured public and private markets, and elevated cash-burn levels from our clients as they invest in their businesses.” Its shares fell more than 60% Thursday. In pre-market trade on Friday SVB shares were down another 60% after overnight reporting from Bloomberg said VC firms ranging from Peter Thiel's Founder Fund to Union Square Ventures had told portfolio companies to pull their money from Silicon Valley Bank. Banks don't have to realize losses on bonds that may have gone down in value amid rising rates if they're not pushed to sell these assets. But Silvergate Capital and SVB Financial didn’t have that choice. Customer withdrawals at Silvergate Bank and SVB’s Silicon Valley Bank forced their hand. At Silvergate, which caters to cryptocurrency clients, customers yanked their money in the panic that followed the 2022 collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Silvergate said in January that it had realized losses of $886 million from selling securities as deposits fell. That weakened the bank considerably. On Wednesday it said it would wind down its bank, and its shares plunged Thursday. After disclosing the $1.8 billion loss and new capital raise, Silicon Valley’s CEO Greg Becker urged calm in a call with venture capitalists Thursday, according to The Information, asking these investors not to withdraw money. It now is seeking to raise $2.25 billion of new capital to cover the new losses. The concern now among investors is that much bigger banks could be forced to do the same. That sent the stocks of giant financial institutions tumbling Thursday, including the biggest of the big: JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC). A major bank index fell by the most Thursday in nearly three years. The biggest U.S. banks are much stronger than they were in the lead up to the last big banking crisis, in 2008, in part because regulators forced them to hold more capital and survive numerous stress test scenarios over the last decade and a half. And the giants have more diverse funding and customer bases than banks such as Silicon Valley or Silvergate, which gives them many more options during challenging times. Longtime banking analyst Mike Mayo said Thursday during an appearance on CNBC the biggest banks are ""a pillar of strength and stability"" and much more resilient than they were prior to the 2008 crisis. ""The biggest risks are outside the largest banks,"" he said, and yet all banks are ""getting painted with the same brush."" Bank stocks, he said, ""have gotten Powelled,"" referring to the Fed chair. ""Going from zero to 5% interest rates in a period that is faster than any time in four decades, you are going to have casualties."" Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chair Martin Gruenberg highlighted the new interest rate risks facing the industry during a speech on March 6, noting that unrealized losses on available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities totaled $620 billion at the end of 2022 across all U.S. banks. ""The current interest rate environment has had dramatic effects on the profitability and risk profile of banks’ funding and investment strategies,"" he said. ""First, as a result of the higher interest rates, longer term maturity assets acquired by banks when interest rates were lower are now worth less than their face values. The result is that most banks have some amount of unrealized losses on securities."" These unrealized losses, he added, ""weaken a bank’s future ability to meet unexpected liquidity needs."" The good news, according to Gruenberg, is that ""banks are generally in a strong financial condition, and have not been forced to realize losses by selling depreciated securities.""

2023-03-09,GC=F,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-today-live-updates-march-9-2023-135006552.html,"Stocks got crushed on Thursday as worries rippled through the banking sector and investors remained on edge ahead of a crucial February jobs report slated for Friday morning. At the closing bell, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down 1.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was off by 1.6%, or 542 points, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down by 2%. Through Thursday's close the market was on pace for its worst week of the year, Bloomberg data showed. The selling on Thursday accelerated throughout the trading session as a collapse in shares of SVB Financial (SIVB) pressured bank stocks and raised concerns over previously unforeseen knock-on effects from the Federal Reserve's rate hiking campaign on the financial system. On Wednesday, SVB announced a $2.25 billion capital raise and the sale of nearly all of its securities portfolio for a loss of $1.8 billion. The company's Silicon Valley Bank subsidiary is the bank for many startups and other players in the venture world. In a letter to investors on Wednesday, the company said: ""We are taking these actions because we expect continued higher interest rates, pressured public and private markets, and elevated cash burn levels from our clients as they invest in their businesses."" The Information reported Thursday afternoon Greg Becker, CEO of Silicon Valley Bank, said on a call with investors, ""I would ask everyone to stay calm and to support us just like we supported you during the challenging times."" Becker also reportedly told investors the bank has ""ample liquidity,"" but said that ""if everyone is telling each other SVB is in trouble, that would be a challenge."" SVB shares fell 60% on Thursday. This decline also weighed on regional banks, with the SPDR Regional Banking ETF (KRE) falling 8% while the SPDR Financial Sector ETF (XLF) fell some 4%. Among major U.S. money-center banks, shares of JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), and Wells Fargo (WFC) were all down more than 5% on Thursday. First Republic Bank (FRC), which maintains a large high net-worth clients business, saw shares fall 16% during Thursday's trading session. As Bloomberg's Jonathan Ferro tweeted, Thursday seems to have marked the moment in the rate-hiking cycle that higher rates are good for banks until they are no longer good. Earlier Thursday, labor market data had been the main catalyst for the market as investors await a crucial jobs report set for release Friday morning. The weekly report on initial filings for unemployment insurance Thursday morning showed 211,000 claims were filed last week, an increase of 21,000 from the prior weak and what economists at Oxford Economics called the ""first hint of weakness"" in this data. ""The jump in jobless claims to 211k last week from 190k is the first sign of weakness in the claims data this year but is still well short of the 300k+ level that would be consistent with a recession,"" Michael Pearce, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients. ""As the Fed presses ahead with more rate hikes, we expect layoffs to eventually rise significantly."" The initial pop from stocks following this data came after two days of testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made clear interest rates are likely to go higher than expected amid strong labor market and inflation data. Stocks finished Wednesday's trading session mixed after a sell-off Tuesday that was triggered by comments from Powell suggesting the Fed will need to raise rates higher than previously forecasted amid stubborn inflation. ""I was surprised by Powell's willingness to accelerate the policy tightening pace, but I am not surprised by the admission that terminal rates will need to rise further,"" said Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro. ""At present, the futures market is priced for a [50 basis point] move in March. There is no point cracking open a door if you don’t intend to walk through."" Data from the CME Group shows markets placing an 80% on the Fed raising rates by 0.50% later this month. Elsewhere in markets, WTI crude oil fell about 1.5% to trade near $75.50 a barrel, a retreat from the $80 a barrel oil was trading near earlier this week. Investors were also keeping a close eye on the Treasury market with the 10-year yield firmer by about 5 basis points, trading at 3.92% after a move higher in yields earlier this week led to a deepening inversion of the yield curve. In single-stock news, shares of Silvergate (SI) were in focus on Thursday after the bank said late Wednesday it would liquidate and wind down its operations after suffering heavy losses amid huge deposit outflows from its digital asset client base. Shares of Silvergate, which have lost more than 95% over the last year, fell 41% on Thursday. Other stocks on the move on Thursday included MongoDB (MDB), which fell 8.3% following a disappointing quarterly report. On the flip side, shares of Asana (ASAN) gained 19% Thursday after a surprisingly strong quarter.

2023-03-09,GC=F,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/banks-tumble-svb-ignites-broader-173433069.html,"By Sinéad Carew (Reuters) - The S&P 500 bank index tumbled nearly 6% on Thursday in its biggest one-day drop in over two years as investors fled the industry following SVB Financial Group's share sale announcement and crypto bank Silvergate's decision to wind down operations. Shares of SVB, whose operating segments include Silicon Valley Bank, slumped over 50% in their deepest one-day drop on record after the company announced a $1.75 billion share sale late on Wednesday. SVB is battling cash burn due to declining deposits from startups struggling with a venture capital funding drought. San Francisco headquartered First Republic slumped 15% after hitting its lowest level since October 2020. The SPDR S&P regional banking ETF dropped more than 7% to its lowest level since January 2021. Major U.S. banks were also hit, with JPMorgan and Bank of America both down more than 5%. First Republic and SVB were the S&P 500's deepest percentage decliners in Thursday's trading session, while JPMorgan's loss weighed more than any other stock on the S&P 500's 1.1% decline at mid-day. ""The Silicon Valley raise got everybody nervous about people's capital levels and what deposits are doing. A lot of institutional investors don't feel great about owning certain banks right now,"" said R.J. Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. ""It just gets people freaked out because Silicon Valley, historically has been a very strong, well-run bank. If they're having issues right now, people are wondering what about other banks that are lesser quality and that don't have the reputation that Silicon Valley Bank has."" Investors were also grappling with the decline of cryptocurrency-focused lender Silvergate Capital, which dropped 22% after saying late on Thursday it planned to wind down operations and voluntarily liquidate after it was hit with losses following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. Shares in Silvergate peer Signature bank fell 9.4%.

2023-03-09,GC=F,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/mortgage-rates-increase-again-flirt-with-7-170227323.html,"Mortgage rates surged higher this week, closing in on 7%, further cementing affordability concerns in the housing market. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage increased to 6.73% from 6.65% the week prior, according to Freddie Mac. Rates have climbed nearly three-quarters of a point since the beginning of February. The jump in rates continued to fuel the standoff between price-struck homebuyers and hesitant sellers, as elevated home prices weigh on already weak demand ahead of the spring season. Add to that the expectation that rates could soon crest 7% if inflation remains a top concern. “It's not just higher mortgage rates, but really the combination of higher mortgage rates and still higher home prices in most markets that are creating hurdles for buyers,” Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale, told Yahoo Finance. “Even though a greater share of home sellers in today's market have adjusted their price lower, both listing and sale prices have continued to climb on a year-over-year basis.” While the volume of applications to purchase a home increased by 7% for the week ending March 3, overall purchase activity was 42% lower than a year ago, the Mortgage Bankers Association latest survey found. “Even with this jump in activity, both purchase and refinance applications remain well below year-ago levels when rates were much lower,” MBA President and CEO Bob Broeksmit told Yahoo Finance. “The recent increase in mortgage rates, right at the start of the busy spring buying season, could cause prospective buyers to delay decisions until rates moderate.” Buyers still in the market also have to contend with higher list prices from sellers. The national median listing price increased to $415,000 in February, Realtor.com data showed, up from $406,000 the previous month and up 7.8% year over year. That reverses several months of softening listing prices after peaking in June at $449,000, and could suggest that sellers are getting stubborn in offering incentives. Without wiggle room on prices, buyers are seeing their purchasing power evaporate amid rising interest rates. For instance, the monthly mortgage payment for a median-priced home is 49% higher than a year ago at last week’s rate of 6.65%, according to Realtor.com. Buyers are likely to face further affordability challenges entering the spring, Hale noted, because too-low inventory will continue to buoy home prices. “One big reason that home prices continue to climb is that even though we have more homes for sale today, the market is still not back to what was common before the pandemic in most places,” Hale said. “And fewer homes for sale mean there's still some pressure on prices even though buyers are more selective amid higher costs.” As homebuyer demand remains weak, home sellers are feeling more pessimistic and are much less active than last year. There were 15.9% fewer homes listed for sale in February compared with last year, data from Realtor.com showed. Meanwhile, there’s some evidence that sellers are a bit less generous with buyer incentives. For instance, 57% of builders used incentives to close sales in February, the National Association of Home Builders said, down from 62% in December and 59% in November. A growing share of sellers are also pulling back on price reductions, more so than what is typical during this time of the year. According to Realtor.com, 13% of home sellers issued a price cut in February, up from 5.4% a year ago. Still, in January at least 15.3% of sellers lowered their prices to make a sale. Mortgage rates have been marching higher since February after government data revealed the inflation remains a threat. This week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell made it clear to Congress that he isn’t ready to soften his aggressive fight on inflation, indicating that further rate hikes would likely be necessary as we enter the spring. That could likely keep mortgage rates higher. Though “forecasting is far more art than science,” Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com, anticipates that mortgage rates are likely to climb higher before they retreat later this year. “At present, and while there is a chance that rates could retreat to recent bottom levels or perhaps a little below at some point, much depends on what happens with prices, with the Fed, and ultimately whether or not the economy gets to a tipping point and starts to head into recession,” Gumbinger recently told Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-09,GC=F,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/9-ways-biden-is-set-to-raise-some-taxes-in-2024-budget-proposal-145357176.html,"President Biden is set to lay out vast and expensive ambitions in his 2024 budget Thursday from shoring up Medicare and boosting domestic spending to reducing the deficit by nearly $3 trillion over the coming decade. To pay for it all, he plans to propose a slate of tax increases, according to multiple peeks at the budget administration officials gave in recent days. There are new taxes on the business world focused on raising the rate on corporate income and on stock buybacks. He will also propose new taxes on wealthy Americans — from changes to how investment income is taxed to a revival of his ""billionaire minimum tax"" on wealth. “I want to make it clear I’m going to raise some taxes,” President Biden said during a recent stop in Virginia, offering one of his many previews of what's to come. Of course, presidential budget proposals are largely symbolic documents that are more about staking out a position rather than being enacted. But they serve as an important marker of Biden’s priorities for the year ahead. “What the president has really here to use is the bully pulpit, meaning once he puts his budget forward, is he going to continue to push some of those ideas?” asked Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget President Maya MacGuineas in a Yahoo Finance Live interview on Wednesday. “If he's serious about it, he'll push it.” Here are some of the new taxes set to be unveiled on Thursday In his budget, President Biden is set to renew his long-standing calls for more taxes on Corporate America. Included in a New York Times preview of the budget document are Biden’s desire to raise the corporate income tax rate to 28% from its current level of 21%. The president is also set to renew his call to quadruple the recently enacted excise tax on stock buybacks, a change he first offered earlier this year during his State of the Union address. On Jan. 1, a new 1% tax on share repurchases went into effect, but has done little to damp business enthusiasm for the practice. The provision is currently set to bring in about $74 billion over the coming decade, and Biden is proposing to increase the rate to 4%. And according to a document reviewed by Reuters, the budget will also propose scrapping tax breaks that oil and gas companies receive. That could likely open up another front in the back and forth between the White House and oil companies over record profits they've enjoyed since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The new proposals come after last year’s Inflation Reduction Act imposed multiple new taxes on businesses, including the 1% stock buyback excise tax and a new corporate book minimum tax. Going after more taxes so shortly after last year's victory likely will inflame critics. Erica York, a senior economist at the Tax Foundation, argued in an interview Wednesday with Yahoo Finance that Biden’s policies were already “heading in the wrong direction and the president's budget is going to double down on that.” “I would say wait and see how it plays out before you double down or quadruple down on it,” she added. Biden is also set to propose new taxes on Americans making over $400,000 a year. The president rolled out his most controversial proposal during this year’s State of the Union with a potential new tax that would target wealth, not just income. “We have to reward work, not just wealth,” President Biden said in his speech. “No billionaire should be paying a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter.” According to a preview offered to Bloomberg, the president will lay out new details on that, including a call for a 25% minimum tax on households worth more than $100 million as well as an increase in the capital gains rate for wealthy Americans. Other tax ideas that were present in previous budgets are set to be revived for 2024, including ending the so-called carried-interest loophole and eliminating some tax breaks around real-estate profits. All told, the various increases would fund nearly $3 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade and also fund other Biden priorities. The deficit reduction will come in a budget that “achieves this while lowering costs for families, investing in America, and protecting programs Americans have paid into because it proposes tax reforms to ensure the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share, while cutting wasteful spending on special interests — interests like Big Oil and Big Pharma,” Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Wednesday. Finally, the White House previewed new taxes to shore up the Medicare program earlier this week. Biden will propose increases on payroll taxes on Americans making over $400,000 per year; closing loopholes that shields some “pass-through” income from Medicare taxes; and allowing Medicare to negotiate on a wider array of prescription drugs. Those provisions, which Biden reviewed in a New York Times op-ed on Tuesday, would extend the program through 2050. Critics have noted that many of these proposals would be untested ways to fund the health care program for retirees. York also noted that some of the rule changes around the net investment income tax would help Medicare's finances by diverting some money from the government’s general fund. “Of course that looks like you're strengthening Medicare, but you're creating a hole in the budget elsewhere,” she said, noting the plan also increases the net investment income tax from 3.8% to 5% and would therefore also bring in more money overall. Republicans have been promising for weeks that Biden’s proposals won’t see the light of day. This is hardly new — there's an old saying in Washington about budgets that “the president proposes and Congress disposes” — but it will nevertheless increase pressure on House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) to offer his own proposal in the coming months. MacGuineas, who previewed the dueling proposals, noted that the White House budget will likely focus on tax increases and the GOP plan will revolve around spending cuts. “Neither of them is realistic, and, frankly, neither of them is the right policy,” she said. “We need compromises on both.” Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. Fed chair Jay Powell just poured cold water on the ""no landing"" crowd hoping to avert a U.S. recession and rally stocks to fresh record highs this year. After two days of grilling before Congress, investors have been reminded (again) that the Fed chief still sees inflation as a persistent, pernicious threat. Stocks and bonds took notice Wednesday, as both sold off amid surging short-term rates — leaving the major indices underwater for the week as of the close. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes,"" said Powell before the Senate. And with two weeks to go until the next Fed meeting, markets are now expecting exactly that. Bonds and derivatives are pricing in a more hawkish outcome — expecting the Fed to lift its benchmark rate 50 basis points instead of 25 basis points. Since Monday's settlement, the U.S. 2-year Treasury-Note yield has surged 18 basis points to 5.06% — the highest level since 2007. It also deepened its inversion over the 10-year yield, with the spread reaching negative 108 basis points (or -1.08 percentage points) — the highest since the early 1980s when Paul Volcker was the Fed chair fighting a similar battle over price inflation. Under normal conditions, interest rates of longer-term loans or bonds (the cost of money) are expected to be more expensive than their shorter-term counterparts, as risk is higher on the long end. But this changes when the Fed starts stamping out animal spirits, lifting short-term rates to restrict the creation of credit and eventually choke off growth. While the magnitude, or depth, of a yield curve inversion isn't necessarily predictive of a deeper, or longer recession, there are a host of other indicators in the bond market that are sounding alarm bells. Former bond trader and CEO of TheMacroCompass.com Alfonso Peccatiello recently joined Yahoo Finance Live to offer his insights. Peccatiello notes that the bond market expects the Fed to fight inflation and remain tight, with interest rates well over 5% a year from now. ""That cannot happen if a recession is unfolding. The Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates,"" he said. Essentially, the inflation-fighting credibility that Powell has earned in the markets comes with a cost — pushing expectations of Fed capitulation far beyond what occurs historically. ""The issue is — the tighter you keep borrowing conditions for the private sector, the higher you keep mortgage rates, the higher you keep corporate borrowing rates — the higher the chances you're going to freeze these credit markets and basically sleepwalk into an accident or, in general, accelerate a recession later on,"" said Peccatiello. But long before the Fed delivers relief in the form of cuts, Peccatiello expects stocks to suffer from an earnings recession, which, he says, ""isn't fully priced in."" (An earnings recession — marked by two consecutive quarterly declines in S&P 500 earnings — often, but not always precedes an economic recession.) Peccatiello believes the U.S. is already in an earnings recession, with stocks reflecting complacency. Nevertheless, he doesn't expect a disaster. He sees about 10% maximum downside risk in the S&P 500 down to the 3600 level, which is right around last year's lows. ""I don't think it's going to be much lower than that,"" he says, adding, ""[T]he stock market generally bottoms before earnings bottom."" The reason gets back to the Fed, which historically capitulates and slashes rates as earnings drop. The Fed rate cuts then get incorporated into better stock valuations, which eventually halt the decline in stock prices, Peccatiello added. ""[This] means the stock market can stop its decline and start slowly but surely moving into a new bull market.""

""We have not made any decision,"" he told the House Financial Services Committee, saying key reports on employment and inflation would govern any moves. The remarks came a day after he told the Senate Banking Committee that, ""we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes"" if the data supported it. That spurred traders to price in a higher chance of a 0.50% hike than a 0.25% increase later this month. “We're going to be looking at the totality of data,"" Powell said Wednesday during questioning from House members. ""We are not on a preset path,"" he added. Powell said the Fed wants to see the upcoming employment report Friday, along with key inflation reports on the consumer and producer price indexes, before making a judgment. On Wednesday, the Dow dropped 0.18%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.14%, and the Nasdaq rose 0.40%. When asked by Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D, Mass.) whether the Fed would pause interest rates to avoid a recession, the chairman called it a serious question and noted that he wouldn’t say yes or no. The Fed, he said, is not ""seeking a recession."" Powell also said the era of low interest rates is likely over. ""Now, we have the 10-year [Treasury yield] back close to 4%,"" said Powell. ""And I think, we need to be careful not to assume that these secular low, longer term rates, will continue indefinitely because it doesn't look likely now."" Democrats, including Democratic Ranking Member Maxine Waters (D, CA) asked him to comment on the prospect of a U.S. default if Congress is not able to raise the debt ceiling. Powell warned that the Fed can’t protect the economy from brinksmanship or a default. ""No one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the non-payment of the government's bills, let alone a debt default, which I don't think will happen, but no one should think we have the tools to protect against the effects of that,"" said Powell. When asked whether the Fed would accept a trillion-dollar coin to avoid a debt default, Powell said there are no rabbits to be pulled out of hats and that would be a ""rabbit coming out of a hat."" House Republicans expressed concerns about reviewing and potentially increasing capital requirements for banks. Patrick McHenry, the chairman of the House committee, questioned the motivation of a ""holistic review"" of these requirements from the Fed’s Vice Chair of Supervision Michael Barr, saying the Fed shouldn’t operate in the shadows when the regulation in question can have broad and significant economic effects. McHenry also accused the Fed of laying the groundwork for a new climate policy. ""The Fed needs to stick to its knitting,"" said McHenry. ""I agree there is concern for many that the Fed is picking up new needles and knitting partisan sweaters at such a precarious time for our economy here at home in the global economy. That would be a mistake."" Powell’s comments Wednesday were his last before the Fed’s policy meeting in two weeks.

2023-03-08,GC=F,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-march-8-2023-124051164.html,"U.S. stocks finished mixed on Wednesday, following two job prints that showed the labor market remains tight amid sticky inflation. Wall Street also heard from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday morning. Powell continued to stress that ""no decision"" has been made on the size of the Fed's upcoming interest-rate increase at its March policy meeting. ""When say we will look at the totality of data, that will include these next reports. We will carefully analyze. Haven't made a decision on the March meeting. Larger point is that we are not on a preset path,"" said Powell during his second day of testimony before Congress. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended the day up 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined by 0.2%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added 0.4%. Bond yields inched higher alongside a stronger dollar. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked up to 3.98% Wednesday. U.S. stocks plummeted Tuesday after Powell said during his Senate Banking Committee testimony that interest rates may rise “higher” than previously expected as the Fed continues a persistent fight against inflation. Powell’s comments on Capitol Hill triggered a 1.5% selloff in equities, according to JP Morgan’s trading desk. Tuesday’s losses saw every sector lower, with financials and real estate logging the biggest declines for the day. Treasury yields were higher, with the 2-year yield tipping above 5%, while the spread between the 10-year and 2-year US Treasury yields inverted for the first time since September 1981. According to strategists at Deutsche Bank, reaching this level signals a recession could be underway or has occurred within a maximum of eight months. “Powell’s speech indicates that the Fed will heavily depend on near-term data for upcoming rates decisions,” Michael Feroli, Chief U.S. Economist at JP Morgan, wrote in a note Wednesday morning. ""With January’s macro data mostly printing on the hawkish side, NFP Friday and CPI next Tuesday are the most critical catalysts for Fed’s decision between 25bp and 50bp,” Feroli added. Still, on the economic data side, ADP’s monthly read on private payroll growth rose by 242,000 in February, above consensus expectations for 200,000. ADP also tracked pay growth for those workers who stayed in their position, which decelerated to 7.2% last month, the slowest pace of gains within in the last year. “There is a tradeoff in the labor market right now,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist, ADP, wrote in the press release. ""We're seeing robust hiring, which is good for the economy and workers, but pay growth is still quite elevated. The modest slowdown in pay increases, on its own, is unlikely to drive down inflation rapidly in the near term.” Meanwhile, the U.S. monthly international trade deficit increased to $68.3 billion in January, below the consensus deficit of $68.7 billion as imports increased more than exports, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the U.S. Census Bureau. Another highlight Wednesday morning was January’s report on the number of job openings, which fell to 10.82 million, down from the upwardly revised 11.2 million openings in the prior month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. The construction, leisure, hospitality, and finance industries showed significant pullbacks in job openings. ""While the January JOLTS report shows job openings are heading in the right direction for the Fed, the decline is far too modest to convince that labor market conditions are cooling enough to bring down inflation,"" Matthew Martin, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a statement following the release. February’s jobs report out on Friday will hold more clues about the strength of the economy. Economists expect 215,000 new jobs will be added to the economy, a slower pace than January’s blowout number of 517,000 job additions. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.4%. Another key point from the reading will be wage growth, with a 0.3% month-to-month bump in average hourly earnings anticipated and 4.7% over the last year. In single-stock moves, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) gained over 2% Wednesday after a regulatory filing revealed that Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway bought nearly 6 million shares of the oil company in recent days, raising its stake in the company to 200.2 million shares worth $12.2 billion. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD) shares rose 3% Wednesday after the security software provider reported fourth-quarter earnings that topped analysts' expectations and issued stronger guidance for the fiscal first quarter. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) dipped 3% as Berenberg analyst Adrian Yanoshik slashed his rating on the stock from buy to hold, citing ""based on misplaced fears of a price war – appears to have been accepted by the market,"" Yanoshik noted. Separately, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened an investigation into the Model Y SUV over a concern with its steering wheels. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-08,GC=F,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/key-recession-indicator-yield-inversion-treasury-160255114.html,"The Treasury market is sending its sharpest warning about recession risks since 1981. On Tuesday, the difference in the yield on 2-year and 10-year Treasury notes further inverted, with the yield on the 10-year falling 103 basis points, or 1.03 percentage points, below the yield on the 2-year yield. This dynamic has preceded each of the last eight U.S. recessions. By this measure, the yield curve has been inverted since July of last year as investors bet aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve to combat inflation would tip the economy into recession. In an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled the central bank will likely be more aggressive than it previously forecast in raising interest rates this year as inflation proves stubborn and the labor market remains strong. ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,"" Powell told the Senate Banking Committee in prepared remarks. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes."" ""Although inflation has been moderating in recent months, the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy,"" Powell added. The Fed will announce its next policy decision on March 22, a statement that will also be accompanied by new projections on where Fed officials see interest rates headed over the rest of this year and the next two. Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients Tuesday that Powell ""opened the door for the central bank to accelerate the pace of rate hikes and raise the target range of the fed funds rate more than anticipated because of the recent hot data on job growth and inflation."" Sweet noted investors are now pricing in 100 basis points of additional rate hikes from the Fed this year, up from the 75 basis points previously expected by most economists. Data from the CME Group showed Wednesday morning markets are now pricing in a nearly 80% chance the Fed raises rates by 50 basis points, or 0.50%, at its meeting later this month. As Yahoo Finance's Brian Cheung noted last year, there is nothing about Treasury yields themselves, or the relationship between the yield at any two points along the curve, that signals recession. Rather, it is what yields imply about future interest rates — and in turn future economic growth — that offers worrying signs for investors. While it is hotly debated what, exactly, ""goes into"" the yield for any Treasury security, a simple axiom used by many investors says Treasury yields indicate what the expected average of the fed funds rate, or the Fed's benchmark interest rate, will be over a given time period. With the 2-year yield standing at around 5% as of Wednesday morning, this implies investors think the fed funds rate will be, on average, 5% over the next two years. Today, the fed funds rate stands at roughly 4.6%, as the Fed's target interest rate range is 4.5%-4.75% following its decision last month to raise rates an additional 25 basis points. Therefore, we can say investors are anticipating the Fed will raise rates to at least 5% and keep them there for two years, or raise rates above 5% for some period of time before cutting them such that the average Fed funds rate is 5%. Duke professor Campbell Harvey, who uncovered this ""recession indicator"" in the 1980s, told Bloomberg in an interview earlier this year he thinks the economy can avoid recession despite warnings coming from his work. In part, in Harvey's view, this is because market awareness of this indicator has lessened its potency as a predictive measure. Notably, Harvey's worked actually focused on the spread between the 3-month Treasury bill and the 10-year Treasury note as the most potent recession indicator, not the now-popular 2-year/10-year spread. The spread between these two tenors along the curve currently stands at minus 107 basis points, still a clear recession signal by Harvey's work.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. The retail business is simple — buy from wholesalers, sell to consumers, pocket the difference. In exchange for capturing this difference between the wholesale and retail cost of goods, retailers take on the financial risk of fronting money to one party while working to make it back and then some from another. At the scale of the U.S. consumer economy, the differences between an additional week in a quarter, an additional weekend in a month, or even an additional day in a year can be millions of dollars or more. And if the timing of a day or two can disrupt the financial fortunes of a business — meaning there can be just hours between profits and losses — then one can imagine the challenges faced by retailers during the supply chain disruptions that results from the pandemic. In 2021, the story was that retailers were unable to match consumer demand as the economy re-opened. In 2022, supply chains that got unstuck eventually left retailers with more stock than they needed. As 2023 gets underway, retailers are suggesting the balance may finally be just right. Sporting goods retailer Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) reported fourth quarter results Tuesday morning that impressed investors, with shares rising 11% after the company offered a full-year earnings forecast well above expectations. And driving this profit forecast were inventories that are in ""great shape"" ahead of the company's busy spring season. ""As planned, we continued to address targeted inventory overages, and as a result our inventory is in great shape as we start 2023. We couldn't be more excited about our spring assortment,"" said Lauren Hobart, president and CEO. Dick's CFO Navdeep Gupta added on a call with analysts Tuesday morning, ""We were chasing inventory last year amidst industry-wide supply chain disruptions. ...Compared to Q4 of 2019, a 38% increase in sales was well ahead of our 29% increase in inventory. Our inventory is healthy and well positioned."" Looking at economy-wide data, we can see inventory-to-sales levels are still depressed relative to pre-pandemic levels. Though this measure is in part driven by strong sales, which keeps the ratio of inventories to sales low. Still, comments from Dick's were the latest echo of a refrain heard often from the industry as retail results have poured in over the last few weeks. And that refrain says the industry is finally finding something like a ""normal"" setting after three pandemic-altered years. Back in late February, Walmart (WMT) CEO Doug McMillon said his team, ""acted quickly and aggressively to address the inventory and cost challenges we faced last year."" ""We ended the quarter with inventory about flat to last year which is better than we anticipated and even better when you consider how inflation lifts that number,"" McMillon added on a call with analysts. ""And [we] did it while improving in-stock levels."" McMillon added: ""And so as we look at where we are today with much better position around inventory...I feel like this year will be more of a normal environment for markdowns or certainly more normal than what it was last year."" The company did, however, say there was ""work to be done"" on its apparel inventory levels. But clothing retailers Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN) both indicated in their latest reports inventory levels continue to improve. ""Despite an increasingly volatile macroeconomic climate, through the ongoing execution of our Polaris strategy, we remained agile, pivoted to meet customer demand and elevated our approach to inventory management,” said Jeff Gennette, Macy's chairman and CEO. ""In the fourth quarter, we benefited from our disciplined inventory approach."" The company reported inventory levels that were down 3% from last year and said, ""Inventory productivity continues to be a focus for the company in 2023 and beyond."" Nordstrom, for its part, said inventory levels were down 15% from last year and at levels similar to those that prevailed in 2019, the last year before the pandemic. ""We took decisive actions to right-size our inventory as we entered the new year, positioning us for greater agility amidst continuing macroeconomic uncertainty,"" said CEO Erik Nordstrom.

At the closing bell on Tuesday, the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 1.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) sunk 1.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) plummeted 1.2%. Tuesday's losses saw the S&P 500 fall by the most in two weeks and trade back below the key 4,000 level. The index also broke its 50-day moving average, an indicator traders closely watch for signs stocks are breaking from recent trends. ""Fed Chair Jerome Powell confirmed today that interest rates are set to rise higher than we previously anticipated,"" wrote Andrew Hunter, deputy chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. ""But with most evidence still pointing to economic weakness and markedly lower inflation this year, we still believe the Fed will begin cutting rates again sooner than markets are expecting."" Powell delivered the first of his two days of semi-annual testimony to Congress on Tuesday, speaking before the Senate Banking Committee ahead of Wednesday's appearance before the House Financial Services Committee. In his prepared testimony released Tuesday, Powell spoke of a sustained central bank campaign to rein in inflation. ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,"" Powell said. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes."" Answering questions from lawmakers, Powell said the full impacts of the Fed's interest rate increases haven't yet been felt in the economy. Markets have begun to price in at least two additional 0.25% rate hikes from the central bank over its next two meetings; investors began the year with optimism the Fed would stop its rate-hiking campaign as soon as February. Powell's comments Tuesday opened the door to the possibility of both a higher terminal federal funds rate, as well as a higher pace of increases. According to data from CME Group, Powell's comments spurred traders to price in a higher chance of a 0.50% hike than a 0.25% increase later this month. The Fed will kick off its next two-day policy meeting in two weeks, with a policy announcement set for the afternoon of March 22. Elsewhere in markets, WTI crude oil was under pressure, falling more than 3.7% to around $77.40 per barrel. The 10-year Treasury yield, which has been a focal point of market action over the last few weeks, was little-changed, settling near 3.98%. On the earnings side, results from Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) early this morning sent shares of the sporting goods retailer higher by 11%. The company offered full-year earnings per share guidance that came in more than $1 per share above expectations, according to Bloomberg data. Dick's expects to earn $12.90-$13.80 per share in its fiscal 2023, up from the $12.04 the company earned last year. Same-store sales in the company's fourth quarter rose 5.3% with CEO Ed Stack telling investors the company's inventory levels are in ""great shape"" to start 2023. Elsewhere in single-stock moves, shares of Snap (SNAP) gained more than 9% on Monday — and had been up as much as 4% on Tuesday before paring gains to close up just 0.5% — with Bloomberg attributing the rally to optimism over a TikTok ban in the U.S. Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"
2023-03-07,GC=F,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/powell-tells-congress-rates-will-likely-be-higher-than-previously-anticipated-150011657.html,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Tuesday interest rates are likely to rise more than previously expected as the central bank works to bring down inflation, which remains stubbornly above the central bank's 2% target. U.S. stocks were trading lower Tuesday as some analysts said the comments were more hawkish than expected. Near 2:20 p.m. ET, the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) was near session lows, falling 1.5%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) off 1.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) falling 1.2%. ""The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,"" Powell told the Senate Banking Committee in prepared remarks. ""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes."" ""Although inflation has been moderating in recent months, the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy,"" Powell added. The latest Consumer Price Index report released last month showed prices rose 6.4% over the prior year in January, a slowdown from last summer's peak inflation rate of 9.1% but still well above the Fed's 2% target. Powell's comments spurred traders to price in a higher chance of a 0.50% hike than a 0.25% increase later this month, according to data from CME Group. In a note, Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner said Powell’s remarks ""opened the door"" to a return of 0.50% hikes, ""If the incoming data flow warrants it."" If there are ""upside surprises"" in a jobs report this Friday from the Labor Department, that could ""drive a faster and longer tightening cycle,"" according to Zentner's note. The Fed projected at its December policy meeting interest rates would need to rise to a range of 5%-5.25% this year, though Powell's comments now suggest rates will need to eventually rise above this level. Following the Fed's February policy decision, the central bank's benchmark interest rate stands in a range of 4.5%-4.75%. Some Senate Democrats challenged Powell during Tuesday’s hearing, cautioning that his rate hikes could lead to job losses. Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown (D-OH) said there are other ways to bring down prices, citing the strengthening of supply chains, boosting of U.S. manufacturing and the rebuilding of infrastructure. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said if the central bank raises rates as much as planned, to 5%-5.25% excluding any further rate hikes Powell has now suggested above that level, unemployment would rise to 4.6%. That, she said, would cost two million people jobs. ""Chair Powell, if you could speak directly to the two million hardworking people who have decent jobs today, who you're planning to get fired over the next year, what would you say to them?"" Warren asked. Powell, in response, said: ""I would explain to people more broadly that inflation is extremely high and it's hurting the working people of this country badly. All of them, not just two million of them, but all of them are suffering under high inflation, and we are taking the only measures we have to bring inflation down."" In a hat tip to these concerns, Powell said in his prepared remarks that the Fed is ""acutely aware"" high inflation is causing ""significant hardship"" for Americans while also pledging to “stay the course until the job is done."" The Fed chair said Tuesday policymakers will continue to make decisions on a meeting by meeting basis. Powell noted that economic data from January on inflation, job growth, consumer spending, and manufacturing production have partly reversed course from the slowdown seen back in December. Powell attributed some of the softening to unseasonably warm weather in January, but cautioned that the ""breadth of the reversal"" suggests inflation is running higher than expected. He reiterated the Fed still needs to see a drop in services inflation excluding housing to bring inflation down, which is likely to require a weaker job market.

2023-03-07,GC=F,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/heres-what-biden-wants-to-do-to-shore-up-medicare-135302609.html,"President Biden is set to formally release his 2024 budget proposal later this week and is already offering previews on what he plans to do with Medicare. In new details released Tuesday to keep the program afloat into the 2050s, Biden says he can extend the solvency of the program without any benefit cuts via three moves: an increase on the tax rate on both earned and unearned income above $400,000; the closing of loopholes that shields some “pass-through” income from Medicare taxes; and allowing Medicare to negotiate on a wider array of prescription drugs. And overall, the president is looking at least five different tax changes for wealthy Americans and corporations to pay for his myriad ideas — both for Medicare and his larger push to “invest in America” and pay down the deficit. And while the proposal isn’t likely to get a vote on Capitol Hill, it will serve as an important marker of Biden’s priorities. The early focus on Medicare — as well as Social Security — underlines just how “deeply embedded” the twin programs have become in Biden’s political identity, Alex Lawson, the executive director of a group called Social Security Works, recently noted in an interview. The president talks nearly every week about the program and also released a New York Times op-ed on the topic Tuesday morning. Defending the programs now “seems to be one of the defining characteristics of Biden-world,” Lawson added. What the White House appears to be doing with this week’s choreographed multi-day rollout — culminating in a formal unveiling on Thursday in Philadelphia — is an attempt to shape the conversation as both the debt ceiling fight heats up this summer and a likely Biden 2024 re-election campaign kicks off. In the op-ed released Tuesday morning, President Biden wrote that “Medicare is more than a government program. It’s the rock-solid guarantee that Americans have counted on to be there for them when they retire."" The issue is top of mind with a key Medicare trust fund likely to run low on funds as early as 2028, according to a recent government trustees report. Meanwhile, Social Security likely has the funds to continue paying out current benefits for only a few years longer, through 2034. Biden’s proposal would increase the Medicare tax rate from 3.8% to 5% on all income above $400,000. It would also target what is known as net investment income - an additional fee on the returns for high-income earners as well as “pass through” business for Americans above $400,000 per year. The White House aims to change the rules and close loopholes around that income, which it notes can be shielded from the taxes that fund the Medicare program because it is classified currently as “neither earned income nor investment income.” The proposal would close loopholes in that area and also change the government's rules to allow that money to be sent to Medicare’s crucial Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, President of the American Action Forum, noted in a Yahoo Finance Live interview on Tuesday that the net investment tax piece is ""really using a tool that has never been used in Medicare before [and] it's not a particularly good piece of tax policy."" Holtz-Eakin, a Republican and former director of the Congressional Budget Office, added that the way to get these programs under control fiscally is to control growth, and ""you can't tax your way out of this."" The budget will also propose savings via new prescription drug reforms by giving Medicare the authority to negotiate prices for additional higher-cost drugs. The White House estimates these changes will save $200 billion over the coming decade. “There are ways in which the program can be operated more efficiently,” said Paul Van de Water, a Medicare specialist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who also listed other options for the years ahead like lowering payment rates to healthcare providers and limiting payments to Medicare Advantage. But even with all that, “it's still going to be essential we think to raise additional revenues,” he said. Van de Water also noted that Biden has previously proposed changes to the net investment income tax during a previous budget proposal. Thursday’s release will be Biden’s third since taking office. Tuesday’s unveiling is just the first step in what is much more detail to come about Biden's ideas and how he’ll pay for it all. In a recent online video, Biden’s budget director, Shalanda Young, outlined the overall priorities, including expanding the economy, lowering costs, protecting Social Security and Medicare as well as reducing the deficit by $2 trillion over the coming decade. So what other tax increases could be proposed? Administration officials say that both wealthy Americans and corporations will be the focus. In his State of the Union, Biden called to quadruple the excise tax on stock buybacks and to institute a new ""billionaire minimum tax"" on wealth. Both appear set for repeat appearances on Thursday. The president could also call to raise the top corporate tax rate, which would come in addition to a corporate minimum tax instituted last year as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. While House Republicans have pledged that all tax increases are off the table and won't be considered in the House. But the move will increase the pressure on Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) to release his own plan, something he has promised is coming soon. What Speaker McCarthy has discussed in the past is creating the “path” to balance the budget. House Republicans have already floated some small-scale proposals — targeting things like Medicaid and what they term as “woke waste.” What’s unclear — and Democrats and some budget experts charge is impossible — is how that plan takes a significant bite out of the deficit if Social Security, Medicare, and tax increases are all off the table. “We’re not going to sit here and be lectured by those folks about fiscal responsibility,” Biden said recently in a preview of the likely debate to come, adding of the GOP, it will “be interesting to see what they want to cut and what their numbers add up to.” This post has been updated.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. When Fed Chair Jay Powell settles in for his semi-annual testimony to the Senate Banking Committee today, investors will be looking for confirmation that the central bank is going to keep raising interest rates for the next several meetings to fight inflation. Besides the ongoing debate about whether the Fed’s actions are going to send the U.S. economy into recession and stocks into a tailspin, there’s been one other important side effect: the bond market is the hottest it’s been in years. That’s newly true not just for institutional investors, but for retail traders as well. That’s because online trading of Treasuries is accessible at a critical mass for the first time with rates at these levels. It's never been easier to buy, be it directly via the Treasury Department, from the discount brokerages, or through ETFs. The repricing of rate expectations this year has sent yields on many Treasury notes and bonds to their highest in 15 years, with the 2-year, 10-year (TNX), and 30-year all yielding around 4%. It’s been a huge shift for fixed income. Besides institutional investors salivating over government and corporate debt, retail traders are so keen they've repeatedly crashed the TreasuryDirect website, which provides a conduit to Treasuries and I bonds. (The latter is an inflation-protected instrument that has both a fixed rate and one that changes with inflation). “For pretty much the entire decade, leading up to this year, when people asked about retail and fixed income, I could just simply say, ‘no one really cares.’ The past year, that has significantly changed,” Shawn Cruz, Head Trading Strategist at TD Ameritrade, told Yahoo Finance. Sales of Treasury bills – those with maturities of one year or less – through TreasuryDirect were $12.0 billion in January, a record. Before last August, that number hadn’t cracked $5 billion. Net sales of I bonds were $4.2 billion in January, after spiking to $6.8 billion last October. Salim Ramji, Global Head of iShares and Index Investments at BlackRock, was enthusiastic about fixed income when he recently spoke to Yahoo Finance: “It’s a great time for investors to look for yield, but they don’t have to take the kind of risk that they might have two, three, four years ago, because you can get 4% yields in Treasuries. You can get 5% yields in investment grade, even at the front end.” BlackRock, as the largest provider of ETFs by assets, has benefited from the boom. Thus far in 2023, investors have poured $9.9 billion into U.S. iShares fixed income ETFs. And not all investors are going long; the firm’s most popular instrument in February in the category was the iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF (SHV). How long will the party last? Even if the Fed raises interest rates at its next three meetings, some strategists have called for a longer period of higher inflation and higher interest rates, an end to the so-called “Great Moderation.”  BlackRock predicts that fixed income ETF assets under management will reach $5 trillion by 2030. As Ramji said, “Having rates as low as they were for as long as they were was kind of the aberration. I think we’re resetting back now to a much more normal fixed income environment, and the great thing for investors, as a result, is they can use it to generate income, and so for retirees or people looking at their wealth portfolios, they’re able to generate good, long-term income from long-term investments like Treasuries or investment grade.” In other words, for a lot of retail investors right now, boring is beautiful. - Economy Wholesale Inventories, January Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before Senate Banking Committee Earnings Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS); Casey's General (CASY); CrowdStrike (CRWD); Manchester United (MANU); Sea Limited (SE); Stitch Fix (SFIX); Thor Industries (THO) Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended the session near the flatline, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) increased 0.1%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) edged down 0.1%, reversing its gains from earlier in the trading session. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note hovered near 4% Monday afternoon, before settling at 3.98%. Crude oil traded higher, with U.S. benchmark WTI up at $80.55 a barrel. The dollar index moved lower trading at $104.34. U.S. stocks gained on Friday to close out a volatile week, while bond yields pulled back from their recent highs. The three major indexes rose for the week, with the Dow Jones adding 1.7%, the S&P 500 closing 1.9% higher, and the Nasdaq gaining 2.6%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury settled back below the key 4% level, and the two-year yield fell to 4.86%. Economic data released on Friday showed the services sector grew in February. This week, Wall Street will be paying close attention to the monthly jobs report out Friday. The February jobs report is expected to show 215,000 new jobs have been added to the economy, according to economist estimates, a slower pace from January’s blowout number of 517,000 job additions. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.4%. Another key point from the report will be wage growth, with a 0.3% month-to-month bump in average hourly earnings anticipated and 4.7% over the last year. Economists at Bank of America, led by Michael Gapen, believe a deceleration from January will be tied largely to weather shifts and a general mean-reverting nature of payrolls. ""Typically, when payroll growth records a sizable increase or decrease, we see a reversal in the following month,"" the firm noted. Also, investors will be keeping an eye on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's two-day biannual monetary policy testimony on Capitol Hill, which begins Tuesday. Other highlights this week include ADP’s monthly read on private payroll growth, January’s report on job openings from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Fed’s Beige Book. In single stock moves, Apple (AAPL) shares gained nearly 2% on Monday as Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng initiated coverage of Apple with a buy rating and a price target of $199. Ng noted Apple's success in hardware design and brand loyalty has led to a growing installed base of users that provide visibility into revenue growth. And Apple's valuation is attractive relative to its historical multiple and to peers. Ciena (CIEN) shares jumped 4% Monday after the company posted better than expected results that topped analysts expectations amid strong demand in its networking platforms business. Shares of BridgeBio Pharma (BBIO) surged more than 50% after the company topped Wall Street's expectations in a study of children with achondroplasia, a genetic condition that slows bone growth. Snap (SNAP) shares climbed 9% amid growing chatter that the U.S. could restrict — or ban — use of the TikTok app. Spirit Airlines (SAVE) shares tanked nearly 9% following reports that JetBlue Airways (JBLU) is bracing for turbulence from the Justice Department as it tries to block the airline's planned takeover of Spirit Airlines in the coming days, The Wall Street Journal reported. JetBlue shares finished up about 1%.

On February 16, the stock logged its highest close since May 2022. Even after giving back some post-earnings gains, Airbnb stock is up about 45% from a record low reached at the end of 2022. But the sentiment shift came as something of a surprise to hosts and managers using the home-booking platform who say they are finding it harder and harder to book guests. Ric Kenworthy, who manages 96 short-rental property listings through a company, Old Town Rental, in Arizona, was scrambling to fill unbooked units ahead of last month's Super Bowl in Glendale. ""We ended up at, let's just assume midday Saturday before the Super Bowl, close to 90% booked for all of our properties,"" Kenworthy told Yahoo Finance, later adding: ""Some key markets are experiencing quite a bit of saturation."" Kenworthy said he ended up cutting his listing prices by 50%: The going-rate for one of his rental properties went for $450-$600 a night that weekend after he'd been anticipating a rate closer to $1,000 a night given the demand generally created by an event like the Super Bowl. ""In 2022, we saw new heights in demand on the Airbnb platform and the result is continued growth in typical Host income, which was over $14,000 in the US,"" Sam Randall, a representative for Airbnb, told Yahoo Finance in a statement. ""We continue to invest in the success of our Host community and in the coming months will release new pricing tools to help them set competitive prices."" While some Airbnb hosts may not be feeling the full benefits, there is little doubt travel demand is back in full swing. Despite sticky inflation, consumers are booking trips: Data from a Bank of America Institute survey shows money spent on airline travel per household jumped 3.5% in January while international spending also increased compared to two years ago. ""I think the psychological impact of being locked down for some portion of the pandemic has only accelerated the trend that had already started,"" Marriott International (MAR) CEO Anthony Capuano told Yahoo Finance Live after the company's fourth-quarter earnings results showed the average room rates up 13% and revenue earned per average room jumping 29% year over year. Airbnb posted revenue of $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter, better than analyst expectations for revenues of $1.86 billion. The company's earnings per share also topped estimates, coming in at $0.48 cents against $0.08 forecasted. On the company's earnings call, CEO Brian Chesky told analysts Airbnb experienced ""tremendous growth"" in units listed online, ending 2022 with 6.6 million active listings. That was 16% higher compared to the previous year. Chesky attributed the increase in supply to two factors: demand and systematic improvements to their platform. As people flocked back to traveling, nights and experiences booked increased 20% in the fourth quarter, with active bookers in the fourth quarter reaching a record for the company. ""[Annual] revenue of $8.4 billion grew 40% year-over-year,"" Chesky said on the earnings call. ""And when you exclude foreign exchange, our revenue increased by 46% year-over-year."" The average daily rate for an Airbnb accommodation grew 36% compared to 2019 levels, according to CFO David Stephenson. He noted that it's generally ""more expensive"" to stay at an Airbnb than other accommodations and projected rates would come down ""modestly"" through the end of this year. ""We're not seeing any major shifts in overall kind of utilization rate that give us any concern,"" Stephenson said. ""We feel like we continue to keep, in aggregate, this nice balance of growing supply and growing demand, and we want to keep that relative balance."" Airbnb also stressed that the company is focused on three strategic priorities: raising awareness of hosting, upgrading core services, and scaling services beyond its core offerings. In late 2022, Airbnb added short-term sublet listings in an effort to grow its footprint among the multifamily market. The company asserted landlords and property managers using the sublet service could earn about 20% of the booking revenue. Airbnb also rolled out new categories, including one called ""OMG,"" which captures the most unique and exclusive accommodations. And after a Wall Street Journal report highlighted how some travelers were frustrated with host-mandated chore lists and the app's pricing format leading to sneaky costs, Airbnb launched a feature to show users price totals that include cleaning, service, and other fees. Looking ahead, some wonder about the sustainability of Airbnb's boom. “Can the top line demand persist? And then given their growth and supply, can the average rates [hold]?,” Nick Jones, research analyst at JMP Securities, told Yahoo Finance. ""If the demand wanes, that's going to increase available supply at any given day, which then... should result in lower prices, which then would impact their profitability."" Even if demand plateaus, the situation could change: January data from AirDNA suggested that rapid listing growth ""outpaced rising demand"" in 2022. ""U.S. short-term rentals earned over $62 billion ($141 billion globally) throughout the year (up 25.1% YoY), with almost 200 million nights stayed and over two million listings receiving at least one booking,"" AirDNA stated. ""Overall occupancy ended the year at 58.7%, a significant drop from the 61.3% in 2021."" In any case, as travel evolves after the pandemic bust and boom, some Airbnb hosts see a shift in consumer behavior. Michelle Burson, owner of a 4,000 square-foot Airbnb in Brookings, Oregon, is experiencing less foot traffic for her rental unit. ""Our bookings [have] declined last year compared to the previous year,"" Burson said. In Burson's view, ""one of the reasons was people were taking their traditional vacations…going to Hawaii, Europe, rather than driving, [or taking] road trips."" And Masha Löfstedt, who owns three rental properties in Oregon, struggled to get her property booked ahead of the holiday season. ""One of our houses that rents out all the time, nobody's booked for this weekend. That's like the first time in years,"" Löfstedt told Yahoo Finance in late 2022.

While I really enjoyed watching Salesforce and C3.ai shares explode higher post earnings last week, hot movers along these lines have been too few and far between (in either direction) in recent weeks. But if you take a step back and level set the stock market today, the muted action kind of makes a great deal of sense. Investors are facing a fresh dilemma — call it paralysis by analysis amid all the incoming data flying in. On the one hand, we have hot retail sales and inflation reports from the government — both calling into question whether the Federal Reserve is moving fast enough to squash inflation. On the other end of the spectrum, the jobs market continues to be solid (as probably seen in this week's jobs report). Yet, when you look at fourth quarter earnings (and conference calls) from Best Buy, Home Depot, Target and other retailers, you will see consumer weakness in big ticket merchandise. Dig into Target's earnings, and you will see a shopper trading down to cheaper private label goods because they are less inflationary and they just got laid off by a tech company. Taken together, this is a confusing time to be an investor – something market maven Keith Lerner at Truist captures in a new note he sent me: ""The recent action is very much aligned with a key market dilemma we have been highlighting: If the economy stays stronger, as we have seen recently, Fed policy is set to remain tighter, and this will weigh on market valuations. Or, instead, if the economy weakens, this will pressure profits. Neither of these outcomes are favorable for premium market valuations."" In other words, Mr. Market doesn't know what he wants! And if you think all the bad news of any kind is priced into stocks, Lerner adds these considerations: ""For perspective, the S&P 500’s forward P/E of 17.6x is still slightly above the 10-year average of 17.2x, and that’s in the context of a high degree of uncertainty around economic growth, inflation, and earnings. Forward earnings estimates are hovering near a 52- week low, and downside risks remain. The 1-year U.S. Treasury yield has jumped above 5% for the first time since 2007, and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which is hovering around 4%, is nearly double the average of the past decade.""

2023-03-04,GC=F,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/bankman-fried-flip-phone-limited-153437236.html,"By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sam Bankman-Fried should be allowed while on bail to have a flip phone with no internet capability and a basic laptop with limited functions, but be forbidden from using other electronic communication devices, the U.S. Department of Justice said. The proposal to limit the indicted FTX cryptocurrency exchange founder's communications was filed late on Friday in Manhattan federal court, on behalf of the government and Bankman-Fried's defense team. It requires approval by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who oversees the case. Kaplan had signaled at a Feb. 16 hearing that he might jail the 30-year-old Bankman-Fried for testing the limits of his $250 million bail package by communicating in ways that could not be monitored. The judge said he did not want to set Bankman-Fried ""loose in this garden of electronic devices,"" following accusations that Bankman-Fried tried to contact possible government witnesses and used a virtual private network to watch football. Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty after prosecutors said he stole billions of dollars of FTX customer funds to plug losses at his Alameda Research hedge fund. He faces 12 criminal charges under an indictment made public on Feb. 23. The proposed flip phone or other non-smartphone for Bankman-Fried would be limited to voice calls and SMS text messages. Laptop internet use would be restricted to specified virtual private networks, 23 websites for personal use including news, sports and food delivery, and websites to help Bankman-Fried prepare for his scheduled Oct. 2 trial. Bankman-Fried is living under house arrest with his parents, both Stanford Law School professors, in Palo Alto, California. The parents agreed to submit sworn affidavits that they would not bring other electronic devices into their home or let their son use theirs. They also agreed that each device would carry software that periodically takes videos or photos of the user, which court officers would be allowed to review, the letter said. Bankman-Fried's lawyers did not immediately respond on Saturday to requests for comment. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York and Anirudh Saligrama in Bengaluru; Editing by Daniel Wallis)"
2023-03-03,GC=F,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-march-3-2023-133941006.html,"U.S. stocks rallied on Friday, rounding out a big end to the week, while bond yields retreated slightly from their recent march. At the close, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) surged 1.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) increased 1.1%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 2%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note (^TNX) moved back and forth around the key 4% level Friday, eventually settling below the line, after services data showed economic activity expanded in February. Crude oil traded higher, with U.S. benchmark WTI (CL=F) up at $79.71 a barrel. On the economic data side, economic activity in the services sector grew in February for the second consecutive month as the ISM Services PMI came in at 55.1, slightly lower from 55.2 recorded in January and above economist expectations of 54.5. February's ISM Services figures ""suggests activity continues to expand at a reasonably healthy pace, but provides further reason to doubt the idea that there has been a resurgence in growth since the start of the year,"" Andrew Hunter, deputy chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note following the release. The moves come after the Federal Reserve published a semiannual Monetary Policy Report to Congress that details the central bank's plans to hike interest rates as a means to restore price stability. Officials indicated ""that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2% over time,"" the Fed said in its report. Stocks rallied on Thursday, with the S&P 500 trading lower for most of the session before rallying after commentary from Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic. Bostic said he’s still open to raising rates by another quarter percentage point at the central bank’s March meeting. “I let the data guide me,” Bostic told reporters in a press briefing. “If the data continue to come in suggesting the economy is stronger than I had projected, I’ll adjust my policy trajectory.” Bostic, who isn’t a voter on monetary policy this year, wrote an essay on Wednesday calling for the Fed to raise its policy rate by 50 basis points to a range of 5%-5.25% and then keep it there until well into 2024. Fed officials raised the benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point in February, pulling the target to stand in a range of 4.5%-4.75%. Policymakers will be releasing new projections after the central bank’s March 21-22 meeting. In single stock moves, C3.ai (AI) shares surged over 30% Friday after the company posted fiscal third quarter revenue that came at $66.7 million, beating analyst expectations of $64.2 million. Shares of Rivian (RIVN) jumped after the EV maker said on Friday it's keeping to the original production forecast of 50,000 vehicles in 2023. Costco (COST) shares sank 2% after the bulk retailer posted mixed results for the second quarter. Total revenue for its latest quarter was $55.27 billion, slightly below analysts' expectations of $55.58 billion. During the earnings call, the company provided some hopeful news on the inflation front. ChargePoint (CHPT) shares were down Friday after the maker of EV charging stations reported disappointing results and issued softer guidance. Shares of Amazon (AMZN) were up 3% as the company pauses construction on its second quarters in Arlington, Virginia. The move follows the tech giant's announcements of job cuts in the wake of slowing consumer and corporate spending. Marvell Technology (MRVL) stock fell after the company reported mixed results, with earnings in line with expectations but guidance weaker than forecasted. Shares of Meta Platforms (META) surged 6% as the company announced it would slash prices of its Quest Pro virtual-reality headset after the product launch. In the cryptocurrency market, both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) fell as customers pull their funds from crypto bank Silvergate (SI), whose stock plunged more than 57% during the trading session on Thursday. Following the drop in Bitcoin, the pullback is close to 10% and the digital asset was on pace to close below its 50-day moving average for the first time in almost two months, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-02,GC=F,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-today-march-2-2023-135533324.html,"Stocks rallied on Thursday with the Dow leading markets higher as results from Salesforce (CRM) lifted the index, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq shook off early losses to finish in the green. At the close on Thursday, the S&P 500 was up 0.76%, the Nasdaq higher by 0.73%, and the blue chip Dow up 1.05%. Rates remained a key focus for investors, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note settling north of 4%, its highest level since November. The rise in yields has come as investors brace for more aggressive action from the Federal Reserve in the coming months as inflation stays elevated and the economy remains strong. On the front end of the Treasury curve, the yield on 2-year notes continued to trade near its highest level since 2007. The 2-year yield, which stood near 4.8% on Thursday, is seen as the best proxy for investor expectations of the Fed's near-term path for interest rates. In single-stock moves, shares of Salesforce rose 11.5% on Thursday as investors cheered the company's latest quarterly report, which saw the embattled Dow member double down on cost-cutting initiatives and shareholder return plans. The stock's opening gap higher of 16% was its largest since Aug. 2020, according to data from Bloomberg. In an interview with Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi late Wednesday, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in reference to the company's efficiency initiatives: ""We have hit the hyper-space button."" The company announced in its quarterly report an increase in its share repurchase authorization to $20 billion, with COO Brian Millham telling investors on a call, ""We're inspecting every part of our business to find opportunities to drive efficiencies and reduce cost of sales, marketing, and G&A."" Salesforce's 11.5% jump, good for jsut over a $19 per share increase in the stock price, added roughly 110 points to the price-weighted Dow's 340 point gain on Thursday. Elsewhere in single-stock moves, shares of troubled bank Silvergate (SI) fell 57% on Thursday after the company delayed the filing of its annual report and said it would likely report losses larger than those previously disclosed. The bank took on several high-profile crypto clients in recent years and has seen its share price collapse by more than 90% in the wake of the failure of FTX, among other crypto bankruptcies. Tesla (TSLA) shares were also in focus on Thursday, falling 5.9% as the electric carmaker held its latest investor day on Wednesday, which revealed few new product details but emphasized the company's push to unlock new efficiencies in its manufacturing and design processes. On the economic data side, the weekly report on initial jobless claims showed 190,000 new filings for unemployment insurance were made last week, the latest sign the labor market remains robust. Though tomorrow marks the first Friday of the month, the February jobs report will not be released until March 10.

2023-03-02,GC=F,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/mortgage-rates-surge-closer-to-7-170022384.html,"Mortgage rates jumped higher this week, getting even closer to 7% and crushing homebuyer activity, which hit a 28-year low. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage increased to 6.65% from 6.50% the week prior, according to Freddie Mac. Rates have climbed over a half-point in February, reversing declines since mid-November. The spike in rates is another blow to would-be buyers, who are also facing still-high home prices and a shortage of affordable homes for sale. Sellers also appear to be pulling their listings, rather than cutting prices further to spur interest. “I think the biggest concern is buying into a market that would continue to go down,” Jeff Reynolds, broker at Compass and founder of UrbanCondoSpaces, recently told Yahoo Finance. “In my 18-year career, I have never seen rate moves like we are seeing now.” The volume of applications to purchase a home slid by 6% from one week earlier, the Mortgage Bankers Association’s survey of applications for the week ending Feb. 24 found. Overall, demand was 44% lower than the same week a year ago and has nosedived to a 28-year low. The drop in demand registered this past month is a sign that affordability remains a top concern, according to Redfin Deputy Chief Economist Taylor Marr. “The housing market took two steps forward in December and January, but has taken one step back in February,” Marr said in a statement. “Mortgage rates crept back this month, which is prompting more buyers and sellers to back off.” Another reason for the pullback in demand is rising home prices. The national median list price increased to $415,000 in February, Realtor.com data showed, up from $406,000 in January. While that’s down 7.6% from June’s peak of $449,000 – it still represents a yearly growth rate of 7.8%. That translates to out-of-pocket costs for buyers. According to Realtor.com, the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home is roughly $630 higher than a year ago. That puts the monthly mortgage payment 45.1% higher than a year ago, exceeding rent growth, up 2.9% from a year ago, and inflation, up 6.4%. As rates continue to climb, fewer home sellers are active this year. The number of newly-listed homes for sale declined by 15.9% in February compared with the previous year, Realtor.com data found. That’s a larger rate of decline versus January’s 10.4% decrease, but a small improvement from November and December. Overall, new listings remained 27% below pre-pandemic 2017 to 2019 levels. According to Redfin, existing homeowners don’t want to move because they don’t want to give up their ultra-low mortgage rates. As of February, approximately 85% of mortgage holders have a rate far below 6%. Homeowners may also be hesitant to put their homes on the market due to soft homebuyer demand that’s forcing sellers to cut prices. “We'll find out in the next 30 days if buyers are getting used to higher rates,” Reynolds said, “or if they will stay on the sideline waiting for rates to come back to earth.” Gabriella is a personal finance reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Subscribe Thursday, March 2, 2023 Today's newsletter is by Jared Blikre, a reporter focused on the markets on Yahoo Finance. Follow him on Twitter @SPYJared. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. In 2004, then-Fed chair Ben Bernanke gave a speech titled, ""The Great Moderation."" His thesis: ""One of the most striking features of the economic landscape over the past twenty years or so has been a substantial decline in macroeconomic volatility."" And while the Global Financial Crisis dented this belief, a post-crisis economic recovery and stock market boom brought these ideas back into vogue among many investors who rode a ""stocks only go up"" rally for more than a decade. But with inflation at multi-decade highs and interest rates at their highest levels in over 15 years, some investors are saying that the old investing epoch has come to an end — ushering in a new era where fundamentals matter, traditional savers are rewarded once again, and the volatility that Bernanke said goodbye to is back. In other words, choppier waters might be the new norm for a while. There are a few things that are starkly different about this present business cycle, Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, told Yahoo Finance Live Wednesday. First, there's the hot labor market, despite the white-collar layoffs. Historically, it's the lower-wage workers that are first in line to get cut. ""Yet another thing about this cycle that is just so different relative to past cycles,"" Saunders said. To date, this downturn has been felt mostly at the upper ends of the wealth spectrum, with asset prices like stocks, bonds, and real estate suffering declines. Meanwhile, inflation is a pernicious problem that disproportionately affects lower incomes. But it has not yet become entrenched — at least in the eyes of policy makers. Investors may not know what to think, but Sonders expects the current fog to lift a bit when we get the next batch of quarterly reports in April. But it might not be a clarity worth celebrating. Analysts have already been lowering the bar for the first quarter earnings, and Sonders believes they have a ways to go considering the bond market is signaling the Fed needs to be yet more aggressive. ""One of the factors most highly correlated to corporate earnings is the 10-year [U.S. Treasury] yield, with a lag,"" she says. Sonders believes the 10-year yield is forecasting the Fed will need to keep rates higher for longer, and that ""the path of least resistance for [earnings estimates] is down"" — targeting the first half of this year. Whether or not that near-term pain materializes, Sonders closes the door on the prior epoch of declining rates and volatility, then describes what investors can expect in the years to come. ""I think that the end of the Great Moderation era is very much here ... Gone are the days of cheap access to goods, cheap access to energy, [and] cheap access to labor. I think all three of those ships have sailed,"" she says. Sonders argues that reversing the engine of globalization and reorienting toward regionalism will have profound investing implications over the secular time frame. ""I would therefore expect greater inflation volatility, economic volatility, [and] geopolitical volatility. We're in this era of regionalization and demographic shifts that are pretty painful."" But as painful as these changes are for workers, consumers and investors alike, there are opportunities for investors. Consider that the Fed has finally raised short-term rates — the so-called risk-free rate — to levels that prevailed in decades prior. ""With the return of the risk-free [Treasury] rate, it's brought secular changes, including the fact that fundamentals are reattaching to prices,"" says Sonders. She goes on to explain that the market is no longer skewed so heavily toward mega cap stocks, and that there's hope for stock pickers once again after over a decade of underperformance. ""This has important implications and helps explain why equal-weighted [stock indices] have generally been doing better than [market] cap-weighted [indices] — why active [investing] has been doing better than passive [investing] — or at least is on a more level playing field with passive. And I think those are secular and as important backdrops for investors to think about.""

The bank said its team ""requires additional time to perform analysis, record journal entries related to subsequent events and to complete management’s evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting."" ""The Company is currently analyzing certain regulatory and other inquiries and investigations that are pending with respect to the Company,"" the company added. Silvergate shares have collapsed over the last year as the company's entanglements with several crypto firms — including bankrupt exchange FTX, among others — resulted in deposits falling by more than two-thirds in the fourth quarter of last year. In January, the company laid off 40% of its staff. The company later suspended a dividend paid on preferred shares as it sought to shore up cash. Over the last year, shares of the bank have lost more than 95%. A spokesperson for Silvergate told Yahoo Finance: ""Silvergate is working diligently to file its 10-K as soon as possible and has no further comment at this time."" In Wednesday's notice, the bank said it sold additional debt securities beyond what was previously anticipated in January and February and it expects to record further losses than what was previously disclosed. In January, the company disclosed it took $887 million worth of non-interest losses in the fourth quarter. The sales are primarily to repay ""outstanding advances"" it received from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, Silvergate said. The bank also needs additional time to complete an ""evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting"" being conducted by its third party accounting firm. Citing business and regulatory challenges, the company is weighing how much the changes might affect its ""ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements,"" according to the filing. In late January, a bi-partisan group of U.S. Senators pressed the company to provide answers over whether it was aware its clients FTX misused customer funds. A Reuters report in February said a Silvergate account controlled by Binance.US moved millions of dollars to a company controlled by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. Last week in a joint statement with the Federal Deposit and Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve made a point to highlight the heightened liquidity risks for banks taking on crypto-related clients. As for its own risks, Silvergate cited “heightened regulatory scrutiny of banking institutions that provide products and services to the digital asset industry,"" private litigation, and investigations from congressional inquiries, banking regulators and the Justice Department. Analysts at JPMorgan downgraded the stock to Underweight from Neutral and withdrew their its price target in a note out Thursday, calling the situation ""highly unusual"" and adding: ""The 'run' experienced at Silvergate appears to have been driven by a combination of (1) trust in the overall system being shaken given the collapse of previously trusted players (such as FTX) and (2) short-sellers voicing concerns (primarily on Twitter).""

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) declined by 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was flat. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell by 0.6%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note moved upward and briefly touched 4% Wednesday. Crude oil traded higher, with U.S. benchmark WTI up at $77.73 a barrel. On the economic data side, U.S. manufacturing firms signaled a grim outlook for the sector, according to the latest PMI data from S&P Global. The seasonally adjusted S&P Global US Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index was revised lower to 47.3 in February, up from 46.9 in January. The reading indicates ""a solid deterioration in the health of the goods-producing sector, despite the pace of decline softening to the slowest for three months."" Separately, economic activity in the manufacturing sector diminished in February for the fourth consecutive month following a 28-month period of growth, according to the Institute for Supply Management report on business. The data offered a mixed bag. Employment in manufacturing decreased to 49.10 in February from 50.60 in January. New orders rose to 47.0 compared to January's figure of 42.5. Prices paid jumped to 51.3 from January's reading of 44.5. Stocks fell Tuesday, rounding out the last day of a volatile month of February on Wall Street. According to JP Morgan’s trading desk, February’s month-end rebalance drove some weakness in equities and strength in bonds Tuesday afternoon. With February in the rearview, the S&P 500 remains up more than 3% this year, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group. Mega-caps have been a massive driver of the index moves. That said, 20 of the largest stocks in the S&P 500 have accounted for most of the index’s gains. Now, as the calendar turns, March historically sees the S&P 500’s gains in the second half of the month, Bespoke Investment Group noted. The path of the Federal Reserve's rate hikes remains in focus for investors. Two Federal Reserve officials spoke on Wednesday leaned in the move that aggressive interest rate hikes are the path forward to ease inflation. They followed Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, who said on Tuesday it would be a “danger and a mistake for policy makers to rely too heavily on market reactions” and emphasized the importance to “supplement these traditional data with observations on the ground from the real economy.” However, Goolsbee, who will be a voter at this year’s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting, didn’t comment on monetary policy. Since last year, the Fed has sharply raised rates in an effort to cool inflation. But inflation remains sticky. Policymakers will be releasing new projections after the central bank’s March 21-22 meeting. On the housing front, mortgage rates continue to move upward, pushing buyers to the sidelines as the spring housing market is underway. Both purchase and refinance applications slumped last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index. Volume of purchase applications hit a 28-year low, down 44% from a year ago. Here are some of the tickers trending on Yahoo Finance today:  Eli Lilly and Company (LLY): The drugmaker announced Wednesday morning it expects to cap out-of-pocket cost of its insulin at $35 a month.

2023-03-01,GC=F,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/goldman-sachs-tries-to-reset-firm-culture-after-three-unusual-years-171038235.html,"Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon addressed negative headlines surrounding the bank's culture during the company's second-ever investor day on Tuesday. ""I hate the noise,"" Solomon said bluntly. ""I live in the same neighborhood as you all live in and I wish the noise was different."" Various media reports of mass partner exits, coupled with recent Wall Street chatter the bank has lost its way after the failure of its consumer banking project Marcus, have all contributed to unfavorable sentiment. And this coming after the company laid off some 3,200 workers positions, or a little over 6% of its headcount, in January after a challenging 2022. Solomon admitted mistakes were made, telling investors: ""I think we’ve accomplished a lot over the past few years. We got some things right, got some things wrong."" ""I read things in the paper that don’t match what’s happening inside the firm,"" Solomon continued, explaining there were fewer partner transitions in 2022 than any other year going back to 2014. ""The culture of Goldman Sachs is incredibly strong. ...We have an extraordinary group of people working incredibly hard,"" he said. ""We also recognize we've gone through a very unusual period over last 3 years — the pandemic was a very tough thing on a culture like ours."" Goldman Sachs shares, down about 5% over the past month, are trading relatively flat year-to-date — underperforming the S&P 500's 3% gain over that same time period. Solomon went on to note Goldman is a ""human business,"" explaining the firm has made conscious decisions to invest in its culture with leadership spending more time with partners throughout the year to help push a greater sense of community throughout the organization. ""We’re going to continue to invest in our culture. I think it's very good, [but] I do think we've had dramatic shifts,"" he said, once again referencing the pandemic which was quickly followed by an unfavorable macro environment. ""That created more noise, more grumbling than usual."" Overall, ""I feel good about the partnerships [and] the culture, but that doesn't mean we don't have to keep investing,"" he reiterated. Goldman saw a rough end to 2022 with profits down a whopping 69% in Q4 amid a serious decline in deal-making revenues, pressured by a weakening economic backdrop. Following Tuesday's presentation, analyst reaction appeared cautiously optimistic, although questions remain over the path to profitability for its consumer banking unit, otherwise known as platform solutions. Shares of Goldman fell about 4% on Tuesday as the company made its pitch to investors. ""Coming out of the conference, the buzz among investors was whether GS will grow the consumer businesses or sell parts of them. Our interpretation of management's commentary is that both options are on the table,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck wrote in a new note published on Wednesday. Graseck maintained her Equal Weight rating and reiterated a 12-month price target of $332 a share. Graseck added all three business segments, which also includes investment banking and trading along with wealth and asset management, ""have an opportunity to contribute to Y/Y EPS growth as GS targets growth opportunities and gets more efficient."" Goldman reported a net loss of $660 million in its platform solutions unit in the fourth quarter with a full-year net loss settling at $1.67 billion. The company blamed the decline on higher provisions for credit losses, but stressed on Tuesday: ""Profitability is not a strategy. It is a priority and the outcome of a strategy well executed."" Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala told clients Wednesday Goldman's profitability push seemed genuine, writing: ""While investors looking for instant gratification may have been disappointed, we believe that management is on the same page with shareholders in that it appreciates the need to further shrink its consumer exposure ""unlock value"" (specifically, card partnerships and point-of-sale lending)."" Poonawala maintained a Buy rating and reiterated a $384 price target on the stock. Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

2023-03-01,GC=F,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/feds-bostic-kashkari-call-for-higher-rates-after-concerning-inflation-jobs-data-150224928.html,"Two Federal Reserve officials speaking Wednesday said more aggressive interest rate hikes are likely necessary to slow inflation, as is the central bank keeping rates at elevated levels for some time. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said Wednesday he is remaining ""open-minded"" about whether the Fed should raise rates by 25 or 50 basis points at its next policy meeting on March 21-22. Markets currently expect a 25 basis point, or 0.25%, rate increase from the central bank. ""I’m open-minded about whether it's 25 or 50 basis points [at the next meeting],"" Kashkari said during a Q&A at a Sioux Falls Business CEO event. ""What's more important is what we signal in the dot plot."" The Fed will release a new set of economic forecasts and interest rate expectations alongside its March 22 policy statement. Kashkari said in December, he jotted down raising interest rates up to 5.4% and holding rates at that level for an extended period. ""At this point I haven't decided what my dot is, but I would lean towards continuing to raise further that I would continue to push up my policy path."" ""Given the data in the last month — higher inflation than we expected and a strong jobs report — these are concerning data points suggesting we're not making progress as quickly as we'd like,"" Kashkari said. ""At the same time shouldn't overreact to one month of data even if the data is troubling."" Kashkari is a voting member of the FOMC, the Fed committee that sets monetary policy, in 2023. Elsewhere, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said Wednesday he believes the Fed needs to raise its policy rate by 50 basis points, to a range of 5%-5.25%, and hold it at that level until well into 2024. ""We must determine when inflation is irrevocably moving lower,"" Bostic wrote in an essay published Wednesday. ""We're not there yet. That's why I think we need to raise the federal funds rate to between 5-5.25% and leave it there well into 2024. This will allow tighter policy to filter through the economy and ultimately bring aggregate supply and aggregate demand into better balance and thus lower inflation."" Bostic is not a voting member of the FOMC in 2023, but will be a voting member in 2024. Bostic said in order to consider reversing the course of monetary policy, he needs to see a better balance in the job market between labor supply and demand and see broad-based inflation narrow. Bostic noted about half of the goods in the CPI market basket still show inflation rates of 6% or higher. The Fed targets inflation that averages 2%. ""If we are going to get inflation back in the range of our target, the breadth of inflation will have to narrow considerably,"" Bostic wrote. ""When inflation is no longer top of mind, our mission will largely be accomplished. We are clearly not there yet. But I—and the Committee—are committed to doing all we can to ensure that we get there as soon as possible."" Both Bostic and Kashkari noted that while the increase in interest rates has slowed the housing and real estate sectors, they aren’t seeing many signs higher rates are really slowing down the rest of the economy. ""Business contacts tell us activity may well soften, but they don't anticipate a severe deterioration,"" Bostic wrote. ""When businesses think customers will buy less of their product or service in the near and medium term, then they will adjust hiring and investment plans accordingly."" Kashkari said the U.S is not in recession right now pointing to strong job growth, but said whether the Fed can avoid causing a recession with its interest rate hikes to fight inflation — a so-called soft-landing —remains an open question. ""The track record is not good at being able to slow down the economy this much without going a little too far and heading into recession,"" he said. ""[But] typically, when the central bank has caused a recession by raising interest rates, the bounce back can be very fast."" Kashkari said the dynamics in this economic cycle are different given families and states have strong balance sheets and supply chains are getting better. Both Fed officials said the cost of raising rates too much outweighs the costs of raising rates too little, adding the Fed must avoid a 1970s scenario in which the central bank cut rates too soon, causing inflation to re-surge and forcing the Volcker-led Fed to hike rates much higher to ultimately bring down inflation.

Follow him on Twitter @MylesUdland and on LinkedIn. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. U.S. consumers and the executives that Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon talks to have a lot in common — they feel good about today and worse about tomorrow. New data out from The Conference Board on Tuesday showed consumer confidence dipped in February, with the decline entirely driven by expectations. The Conference Board's index fell to 102.9 in February from 106 in January and 109 in December; December's reading was the highest since Sept. 2021. Underneath the surface of this decline, however, was another month where a strong labor market lifted consumers' current expectations while fears about the future loomed. ""The present situation index rose for a third straight month, underpinned by upbeat views on employment and business conditions,"" wrote Gurleen Chadha, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, in a note to clients on Tuesday. ""That index rose 1.7pts to 152.8. The differential between jobs 'plentiful' and jobs 'hard to get' rose to 41.5ppts, the highest since April 2022, indicating that current labor market conditions are still quite tight."" In January, the U.S. economy added a surprising 517,000 jobs while the unemployment rate stood at 3.4%. Meanwhile, speaking at Goldman's second-ever investor day on Tuesday, Solomon said the executives he spends his days speaking with are feeling better about a ""soft landing"" for the economy, but that inflation worries are ""hampering confidence."" ""When I talk to CEOs, they feel more uncertain about the course of inflation as we run through 2023, 2024. ...There's a real belief that inflation will be stickier and harder to moderate than markets now predict,"" Solomon said. The Conference Board's data shows consumers remain pleasantly surprised the soft labor market they'd braced for hasn't materialized just as executives fretting over recession remain similarly relieved. And yet both groups in their own way remain braced for some version of economic impact. It's just not clear that hasn't already happened. We're coming off a year in which the S&P 500 fell 19%, the price of gas in the U.S. hit $5 a gallon, and the inflation rate reached 9.1%. In less than a year, the Fed has raised interest rates 4.5%. The housing market got crushed. And the most popular investing strategy for those saving for retirement endured its worst year on record. All things that have improved in 2023. And if there's one theme that been pervasive in markets and the economy for some time now it's a sense from investors and consumers that the worst is yet to come. Economists at Wells Fargo said in a note consumer confidence data ""pours some cold water on the streak of strong economic data received to start the year."" Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, said Tuesday, ""if consumers drive the economy, the outlook for 2023 is bleak as the consumers expect that the worst is yet to come."" On Tuesday, The Conference Board's Expectations Index stood at 69.7, notable as any reading below 80 is typically consistent with recession, according to the report. This index, however, has been below 80 for 11 of the last 12 months. And we wait for the recession still. Solomon said there is typically a ""4 to 6 quarter lag before people reset their expectations."" The question, then, is in which direction do consumers and businesses need to reset expectations against those held today. And, once they do, will it already be too late?

2023-02-28,GC=F,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-february-28-2023-120603661.html,"U.S. stocks fell Tuesday, rounding out the last day of a volatile month of February on Wall Street. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) edged lower by 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined 0.7%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ticked down by 0.1%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked up to 3.92% Tuesday afternoon. The U.S. benchmark WTI crude oil moved higher to trade around $76.94 a barrel. The dollar index was up, trading at $104.92. Stocks closed higher on Monday, fueling a temporary rebound from Wall Street's worst week of the year. All three indexes ended February in the red after an optimistic start to the year in January. Economic data released on Tuesday showed that retail inventories, excluding auto, rose 0.3%, higher than 0.1% expected by economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Meanwhile, wholesale inventories declined 0.4%, below consensus estimates of 0.1%. American consumers felt worse about the economy in February, the Confidence Board reported. The board's Consumer Confidence Index slumped to 102.9 from 106.0, below consensus estimates of 108.5,  Meanwhile, February Chicago PMI dipped to 43.6 from 44.3, also below consensus expectations. “Consumers and businesses are looking for ways to reduce expenses in anticipation of much weaker activity over the rest of the year. The drop in consumer confidence in February aligns with weaker business confidence readings as the Fed’s sharp increase in interest rates start to bite,"" Ben Ayers, Nationwide senior economist, wrote in a statement. Other data showed that home prices fell 0.5% in December, according to data from S&P Corelogic Case-Shiller Index. On a yearly basis, home prices rose 4.6%, lower than analysts' expectations of 4.8%. As inflation still remains sticky, Federal Reserve Governor Philip Jefferson on Monday shot down arguments for raising the central bank’s 2% inflation target and said he is under ""no illusion"" that it's going to be easy to get the inflation rate back down. This week, investors will remain focused on the retail sector. On Tuesday, earnings from Target (TGT) topped analysts' expectations as consumer spending continues to move away from discretionary categories. The retailer’s same-store sales grew by 0.7%, above estimates of a 1.74% decline. The stock rose about 1% on Tuesday. Data from Bespoke Investment Group showed that over the last week, 420 stocks have reported earnings and the percentage of companies lowering guidance is more than double the percentage raising guidance, signaling ""lots of trouble for these smaller-cap companies that report late in the season."" In other single stock moves, Zoom (ZM) shares rose after the company posted better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings, with earnings per share of $1.22 higher than estimates of 80 cents. Revenue came in at $1.12 billion. Occidental Petroleum (OXY) shares moved down on Tuesday after the oil and gas producer posted fourth-quarter results that came in below Wall Street expectations on revenue and earnings per share. Shares of Workday (WDAY) were up after the human-resources software company topped expectations with revenue of $1.65 billion, up 20% year-over-year, against estimates of $1.63 billion. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (AMC) fell jumped on Tuesday after a Delaware court said it would hold a hearing on April 27, which will likely delay the date of conversion of convertible units APE to common stock. Tesla (TSLA) shares fell around 1% as Mexico's president confirmed that the EV maker will build a new plant in Monterrey, Mexico. The Mexican president said more details will be released at Tesla's investor day, and he said the plant is expected to be ""very big."" Shares of Coinbase (COIN) surged as fears of crypto regulation begin to fade. On Monday, the company was served a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission as the regulatory agency cracks down on cryptocurrency listings, its custody of digital assets and platform operations, and more, the company disclosed. Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) shares sank after the company reported a wider-than-expected loss and forecasted disappointing guidance for 2023 as the cruise operator gets squeezed by soaring fuel and labor costs. Separately, Bank of Nova Scotia shares dropped after the Canadian lender reported a missed in earnings estimates as a lull in its investment banking division dented income from its capital markets unit. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. Today the process opens for semiconductor companies to apply for a piece of the $39 billion grant money being allocated as part of the CHIPS and Science Act. But there's a catch: firms that win the funds may not be able to buy back stock – for a while, anyway. “We want to make sure that their money is being used to increase research and development in innovation and not to pad their bottom line or do buybacks,” said Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in an interview with Yahoo Finance. One could argue it’s the administration’s prerogative to decide how chipmakers that accept grants to build factories use that money. But the White House wants to go further, by boosting taxes on buybacks from their current 1%. In his State of the Union address earlier this month, President Joe Biden said that tax should be much higher: ""Corporations ought to do the right thing. That’s why I propose we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks and encourage long-term investments. They’ll still make considerable profit."" That proposal is what may have led Warren Buffett to weigh in on the hot-button issue in the Berkshire Hathaway CEO’s annual letter to investors: “When you are told that all repurchases are harmful to shareholders or to the country, or particularly beneficial to CEOs, you are listening to either an economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue (characters that are not mutually exclusive).” Even Buffett has a caveat, however: he says buybacks make sense only if they are made at “value-accretive prices,” i.e. when corporations don’t overpay. Taking a step back, corporations have a number of ways to spend their money, from building new plants to hiring people to research and development. They can also distribute the funds directly to shareholders by paying out dividends. Or they can repurchase shares, which has the effect of reducing overall share count, automatically increasing earnings per share. (In a simplified example, if a company makes $1 million in profit and has 50,000 shares outstanding, earnings per share are $20. If it buys back 10,000 of its shares, earnings per share go to $25, making an existing shareholder's stake more valuable.) And the numbers are a lot bigger than in the example above. Last year, U.S. companies announced a record $1.223 trillion of buybacks, according to data from EPFR TrimTabs. This year, it’s already running at $274.9 billion — heating up even after the 1% tax kicked in. Eliminating or restricting that tool, then, would be a big deal. Will it actually happen? In the case of companies accepting money as part of the CHIPS Act, it’s unclear whether they’ll be barred from doing buybacks at all, or just directly using the funding they’ve received. (Senator Elizabeth Warren and some of her colleagues in Congress want the participants to be barred from doing buybacks for 10 years). Secretary Raimondo said each case will be different, but the government will in theory have the ability to claw back money in the “most extreme cases” if companies do not comply with their agreements, whether that deals with buybacks or other stipulations. Investors in companies like Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) should take note, since they’re among the firms that have announced plans to build plants in the U.S. and are likely to apply for federal funding. As for whether a broader clampdown on buybacks is coming, policy analyst Ed Mills is skeptical. “Really, what this is about is setting up a strawman, as we get into debates about the debt ceiling,” Mills, a managing director at Raymond James, told Yahoo Finance in an interview. On the one hand, Republicans will fire up their rhetoric about getting the U.S. fiscal house in order. Democrats, led by President Biden, are likely to shoot back by saying Republicans aren’t willing to ask companies enacting big buybacks to pay more in taxes. “I don't think it happens, but I think it's going to be more part of the conversation than I think the market anticipates right now,” Mills said.

The Minneapolis-based retailer saw same-store sales increase by 0.7%, higher than Wall Street estimates of -1.74%. Similar to Walmart's (WMT) latest quarterly results, consumer spending at Target seemed to shift to essentials like food and away from categories like electronics, home, and apparel. Target shares jumped by more than 3.5% in pre-market trading after the report's release. Target CEO Brian Cornell said the team was pleased with the sales growth in what continues to be a ""very challenging environment."" Here's what Target reported, compared to Wall Street estimates, based on Bloomberg consensus data: Revenue: $31.40 billion versus $30.46 billion expected Adjusted earnings per share: $1.89 versus $1.48 expected Same-store sales: 0.7% versus -1.74% expected Brick & mortar same-store sales: up 1.9% versus -2.80% expected Cornell said having multiple category offerings, including food & beverage, in addition to beauty and household items served the retailer well this past quarter, Cornell said. ""Strength in Food & Beverage, Beauty and Household Essentials offset ongoing softness in discretionary categories. This performance highlights the benefit of our multi-category merchandise assortment, which drives relevance with our guests in any environment, and is a key reason we grew traffic every quarter last year."" Same-store sales beat estimates, up 0.7% compared to expectations of a decline of 1.74%. Same-store sales at physical locations also got a boost, up 1.9%, while digital sales dropped 3.6% in Q4. At the end of Q4, inventory was 3% lower than 2021. Meanwhile, in discretionary categories like electronics, home and apparel, inventory was nearly 13% lower than 2021, ""partially offset by higher inventory in frequency categories."" For full-year fiscal 2022 results, revenue grew by $3 billion, to $109 billion. Compared to 2019, revenue is up more than $30 billion. In the full-year, same-store sales increased 2.2%, while traffic was up 2.1%. Looking ahead to fiscal 2023, Cornell said the retailer is focused on it's long-term strategy and ""continued differentiation through affordability, assortment, ease and convenience"" as it competes with other retailers for consumers trading down. ""At the same time, we’re planning our business cautiously in the near term to ensure we remain agile and responsive to the current operating environment...as we plan for the year ahead, we will continue to make robust capital investments and pursue efficiency opportunities in support of our long-term growth."" For the first-quarter of 2023, the company expects a wide range for same-store sales, from a low-single digit decline to a low-single increase, and an operating income margin rate of 4-5%. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.50 to $1.90. For fiscal-year 2023, the company expects same-store sales to be the same, from low-single digit to a low-single increase, along with an operating income of more than $1 billion and adjusted EPS to range from $7.75 to $8.75. In the next 3 years, the company aims to move beyond its pre-pandemic operating income margin rate of 6%, and says it could possibly reach that goal as early as fiscal 2024, ""depending on the speed of recovery for the economy and consumer demand."" — Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-02-27,GC=F,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-live-updates-february-27-2023-130555308.html,"U.S. stocks rose on Monday, fueling a rebound from Wall Street's worst week of the year. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose by 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.2%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased by 0.6%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked down to 3.93% Monday. On the economic data side, new orders for manufactured durable goods in January plunged to 4.5%, the biggest drop since April 2020, the Census Bureau reported. The drop was more pronounced than economist estimates of 4.0%. ""The manufacturing sector will remain under pressure in the months ahead, but the details of January's report of durable goods orders and shipments suggest factory activity started the year on a better note than the headline figure would suggest,"" Lydia Boussour, EY Parthenon senior economist, wrote in a statement following the release. Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors’ index of pending home sales climbed 8.1% to 82.5 in January, sharply higher from the projected rise of 1.0% by Bloomberg economists, according to data the group released on Monday. On a yearly basis, however, pending transactions plunged by nearly 24%. ""The increase in the Pending Home Sales Index confirms that the US housing market has improved, or better put, has somewhat stabilized over the last several months due to lower mortgage interest rates,"" Raymond James chief economist Eugenio Aleman wrote in statement to Yahoo Finance. ""However, the recent increase in mortgage rates is probably going to inflict some more pain on the US housing market going forward."" Stocks closed out their worst week of 2023 on Friday after the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge showed it unexpectedly accelerated in January and consumer spending jumped. The “core” Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index – which excludes volatile food and energy components – showed prices climbed 0.6% in January and 4.7% from last year. The Commerce Department also reported consumer spending rose 1.8% last month from December, the largest increase in nearly two years. The survey’s results renewed anxiety among investors that the Fed would continue its aggressive tightening campaign against inflation. The drop in optimism pressured the major indexes, as the Dow Jones dropped 3% for its fourth consecutive losing week, while the S&P 500 shed 2.7% in its worst week since early December and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.3%. Data compiled by 22V Research has found that rising interest rates have increased the correlation between growth and value stocks to the highest level since at least 2005. This week, investors will remain keen on the retail sector, with earnings from Target (TGT) on deck before market open on Tuesday after Walmart (WMT) warned of cautious profit guidance for the year ahead. Home improvement retail giant Home Depot (HD) also had disappointing guidance for fiscal 2023. Elsewhere on the earnings calendar are results from Costco (COST), Macy's (M), Dollar Tree (DLTR), and Kohl's (KSS) to feature the retail side. Meanwhile, the share of companies topping analysts' expectations in the fourth quarter has been low compared to history. Data from FactSet showed that 68% of S&P 500 companies reported fourth quarter earnings that beat expectations, down from the five-year average of 77% and the 10-year average of 73%. In single stock moves, Seagen Inc. (SGEN) shares jumped Monday morning after a report from The Wall Street Journal said Pfizer (PFE) is in early-stage talks to acquire the cancer drugmaker company in what could be a multi-billion dollar deal. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK-B) stock rose following CEO Warren Buffett’s annual letter to shareholders, which offered readers a glimpse into his views on share buybacks, taxes, corporate accounting, and his sense of optimism about the economy. Shares of fuboTV (FUBO) sank after the sports-focused streaming service issued disappointing guidance in its fourth-quarter earnings report on Monday and disclosed that it had sold stock at a deeply discounted price. Fisker (FSR) shares jumped Monday after the electric vehicle startup announced its deliveries for its first vehicle, the Ocean SUV, would be completed by spring. Shares of Union Pacific (UNP) climbed after the largest freight operator announced its plans to name a new chief executive following pressure from activists to oust Lance Fritz from the job. Bath & Body Works (BBWI) shares fell after the company said in a letter to shareholders that the looming proxy battle is based on ""misguided"" motivations and would be detrimental to shareholders. The board made the decision to not appoint former Third Point co-chief investment officer Munib Islam. Elsewhere, in cryptocurrency news, Coinbase (COIN) said in a tweet that it will soon suspend trading for Binance's stablecoin, Binance USD, on March 13 at or around noon ET. The move comes after Paxos Trust disclosed it will stop creating the Binance-branded stablecoin, citing regulatory pressure. — Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. Salesforce is facing a defining moment in its 24-year history. Growth is slowing. Analysts are worried fundamentals will get worse before they get better as companies curtail tech spending amid a sluggish global economy. A fresh round of layoffs at Salesforce have just been uncorked....at a company that has only known aggressive hiring. Employees are questioning leadership at the tech titan. Co-CEO Bret Taylor is no longer co-CEO of Salesforce — instead he's off to launch an AI startup the serial entrepreneur tells me. Slack founder Stewart Butterfield, who stayed on when the company was acquired by Salesforce, is still founder...but no longer with the parent company. Salesforce co-founder Marc Benioff is back at the CEO helm, after attempting again to pullback from day to day duties (by delegating to a co-CEO) and focus more on his vast philanthropic ventures. To top it all off the company is staring down the barrel of five sharks in the field of activist money management: Elliott Management, Starboard Value, Inclusive Capital, ValueAct, and Third Point. This is an unprecedented activist versus public company battle, pros have told Yahoo Finance. How it ends is wildly unclear, but is a situation just as important as Wednesday's earnings report. ""While the involvement of five activist investors has likely been the primary driver of CRM stock of late, quarterly results probably still matter (though not as much as usual), and how those results are delivered may be more relevant than ever,"" said Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci. Below, Yahoo Finance breaks down this complicated situation at large-cap tech name Salesforce. The drama is high, and it could all be coming down to one final epic conclusion. What Yahoo Finance Is Watching: Salesforce Earnings What sources tell us is top of mind on the Street: How quickly are sales deteriorating inside of the broader tech pullback? What does the pipeline of future business look like? Does Marc Benioff acknowledge the activist situation? Are more layoffs needed? Consensus is that Salesforce warns on sales and earnings for 2023 – but how bad is it? The Vibe Among Wall Street Analysts Analysts are generally expecting a muted tone from Salesforce on earnings day. “For Benioff and Salesforce the actual quarter and FY24 take a back seat to the fluid activist situation which is happening at Salesforce with the Street's patience wearing thin after a head scratcher Slack deal and slowing growth/underachieving margins front and center.” -Wedbush analyst Dan Ives ""Key to the Q4 call is gaining clarity on the extent to which management will turn the dial up on non-GAAP operating margins, GAAP profitability, and any future share repurchases with the emergence of activist involvement in the stock."" -Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss What the Activists Want From Salesforce Sources tell Yahoo Finance that Starboard Value — led by veteran activist investor and Papa John's chairman Jeff Smith — has been disappointed in Salesforce’s expense management, but isn’t advocating for a sale of Slack. Other activists involved in the situation are keen to see a Slack sale even at a low price as a show of faith by management they will improve margins, sources say. Overall, we are told the activists are entrenched and want clear changes from Salesforce leadership. Key thing the activist pool wants: Higher profit margins Realistic 2023 guidance Clear succession plan from CEO co-founder Marc Benioff Like we said, this earnings report is a defining moment in the history of Salesforce.

2023-02-26,GC=F,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stocks-under-pressure-retail-earnings-continue-what-to-know-this-week-142308388.html,"The 2023 stock market rally is under pressure. Inflation data last week that topped expectations — as well as a continued drop in optimism the Federal Reserve's rate hikes will end sooner rather than later — pressured the major indexes with the Dow logging a fourth-straight losing week and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq suffering their worst weeks of the year, losing 2.7% and 3.4%, respectively. The Dow endured its worst weekly performance since Sept. 2022. In the week ahead, investors will remain keyed in on the retail sector, with results from Target (TGT) in focus after rival Walmart (WMT) issued a warning on the state of U.S. consumers last week. On the economic data side, a crowded calendar of reports from the housing and manufacturing sectors — two areas of the economy which have most reflected the impact of policy tightening — is on tap along with a key measure of consumer confidence. On Friday, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index — the Fed's preferred assessment of how quickly prices are rising across the economy — showed prices rose 0.6% during the month of January and 5.4% over last year. On a ""core"" basis, which strips out volatile food and energy components, prices rose 0.6% for the month and at an annual clip of 4.7%. The week marked a turning point in sentiment around inflation expectations and the path forward for interest rates. The hotter-than-expected PCE index followed upside surprises to inflation this year from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and producer prices, which showed the largest increases in several months to start the year. ""The bear market rally that began in October from reasonable prices and low expectations has morphed into a speculative frenzy based on a Fed pause/pivot that isn't coming,"" Morgan Stanley's top strategist Mike Wilson said in a note to clients last week. Wilson's forecast sees the S&P 500 bottoming out at 3,000 this year. On Friday, the benchmark U.S. equity index closed at 3,970. ""Investor optimism had already been hit by a slow puncture this week but it's deflating more rapidly as the latest data indicates that the work in taming inflation is far from over,"" Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in a note. Standout economic data releases in the week ahead include the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index, ISM's manufacturing PMI, and The Conference Board's consumer confidence reading for February. On the corporate side, Target will release its fourth-quarter earnings results before market open on Tuesday with results from Costco (COST), Macy's (M), Dollar Tree (DLTR), and Kohl's (KSS) also featuring on the retail side. Last week, Walmart's CFO John David Rainey said the ""consumer is still very pressured, and if you look at economic indicators, balance sheets are running thinner and savings rates are declining relative to previous periods."" ""We expect Target's results will look similar to Walmart's, with better-than-expected sales, more gross margin pressure than predicted, and solid opex leverage in the store,"" Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe said in a note. Tarlowe warned, however, Target is not ""immune to consumer spending trends shifting to the more needs-based items and away from higher-priced and higher-margin discretionary categories."" Elsewhere on the earnings calendar, notable reports include Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Zoom Video (ZM), AMC Entertainment (AMC), Rivian Automotive (RIVN), and Dell (DELL) among others. — Monday: Durable Goods Orders, January Preliminary (-3.8% expected, 5.6% during prior month); Durables Excluding Transportation, January Preliminary (0.1% expected, -0.2% during prior month); Non-defense Capital Goods Orders Excluding Aircraft, January Preliminary (0.0% expected, -0.1% during prior month); Non-defense Capital Goods Shipments Excluding Aircraft, January Preliminary (-0.6% during prior month); Pending Home Sales, month-over-month, January (1.0% expected, 2.5% during prior month); Pending Home Sales NSA, year-over-year, January (-34.3% during prior month); Dallas Fed Manufacturing Activity, February (-9.10 expected, -8.4 during prior month) Tuesday: Advance Goods Trade Balance, January (-$91.0 billion expected, -$90.3 billion during prior month, revised to -$89.7 billion); Wholesale Inventories, month-over-month, January Preliminary (0.1% expected, 0.1% during previous month); Retail Inventories, month-over-month, January (0.5% during prior month); House Price Purchase Index, quarter-over-quarter, Q4 (0.1% during prior quarter); FHFA Housing Pricing Index, December (-0.1% during prior month); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City Composite, month-over-month, December (-0.54% during prior month); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City Composite, year-over-year, December (6.77% during prior month); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, year-over-year, December (7.69% during prior month); MNI Chicago PMI, February (44.3 during prior month); Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index, February (-11 during prior month); Conference Board Consumer Confidence, February (108.5 expected, 107.1 during prior month); Richmond Fed Business Conditions, February (-10 during prior month); Dallas Fed Services Activity, February (-15.0 during prior month) Wednesday: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Feb. 24 (-13.3% during prior week); S&P Global U.S. Manufacturing PMI, February Final (47.8 prior); Construction Spending, month-over-month, January (0.4% expected, -0.4% during prior month); ISM Manufacturing, February (47.9 expected, 47.4 during prior month); ISM Prices Paid, February (44.5 during prior month); ISM Employment, February (50.6 during prior month); ISM New Orders, February (42.5 during prior month); Wards Total Vehicle Sales, February (15.00 million, 15.74 million during prior month) Thursday: Unit Labor Costs, Q4 Final (2.5% expected, 3.0% during prior quarter); Nonfarm Productivity, Q4 Final (1.5% expected, 1.1% during prior quarter); Initial Jobless Claims, week ended Feb. 24 (TK expected, 192,000 during prior week); Continuing Claims, week ended Feb. 18 (1.654 million during prior week) Friday: S&P Global U.S. Services PMI, February Final (50.5 during prior month); S&P Global U.S. Services Composite PMI, February Final (50.2 during prior month); ISM Services Index, February (54.5 expected, 55.2 during prior month) — Monday: Groupon (GRPN), LendingTree (TREE), Li Auto (LI), Lordstown Motors (RIDE), Oak Street Health (OSH), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Workday (WDAY), Zoom Video (ZM) Tuesday: AMC Entertainment (AMC), AutoZone (AZO), Cracker Barrel (CBRL), Compass (COMP), Duolingo (DUOL), GoodRx (GDRX), HP (HP), J.M.

2023-02-24,GC=F,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-news-today-february-24-2023-104349492.html,"U.S. stocks tumbled Friday after the Federal Reserve's most closely watched inflation measure came in stronger than expected, in another sign that price pressures have become sticky into 2023. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) sank 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) plopped more than 300 points, or 1%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid 1.7%. Friday marked the worst week for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq since December. U.S. Treasury yields scrambled higher following the reading. The 2-year note surged 12 basis points to 4.81% while the 10-year note gained 7 basis points to top 3.95%. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index — the Fed's preferred assessment of how quickly prices are rising across the economy — rose 0.6% in January and 5.4% from last year. On a ""core"" basis, which strips out volatile food and energy components, prices rose 0.6% for the month and 4.7% from last year. The report from the Commerce Department also showed that consumer spending rose 1.8% last month from December after falling the previous month. The numbers support recent indications inflation is not falling at the pace and extent investors have been hoping for, even as prices have stabilized from the peaks of the current inflation cycle. “First December CPI was revised higher, and now each reading for January surprised to the upside. Inflation’s like an old boyfriend or girlfriend that keeps showing up when you don’t want to see them,"" David Russell, Vice President of Market Intelligence at TradeStation said in a note. In individual stock moves, Block (SQ) rose 4.3% after the payments processor reported fourth-quarter financial results that saw profit and revenue top expectations. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) shares fell 1% after the media giant posted a big revenue loss for the final three months of the year. Boeing (BA) shares closed down 4.8% after the airline manufacturer said it paused deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner jets because of a documentation issue. Beyond Meat's (BYND) stock rallied 10% after better-than-expected earnings and CEO Ethan Brown said the company is seeing progress in its efforts to cut costs and manufacturing hurdles. Beleaguered used car retailer (CVNA) plunged 20.5% after reporting a net loss that was nine times wider in the fourth quarter. The bumpier-than-anticipated road to restoring price stability and strong economic data to start the year — nonfarm payrolls rose by 517,000 in January while retail sales surged 3% — have prompted investors to readjust expectations around the path forward for interest rates, putting a dent in the market's recent momentum. The S&P 500 snapped a four-day losing streak on Thursday as stocks closed higher. But earlier this week on Tuesday, stocks had their worst day of the year. ""Equity bulls and even Chair Powell have bragged about anchored expectations for inflation and how consumers and investors believe it is moving in the right direction,"" Morgan Stanley Chief Investment Officer Lisa Shalett said in a note earlier this week, noting that January's Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) raised questions about whether inflation progress is stalling. ""Given data crosscurrents, the central bank needs to tread carefully. Investors still wagering on a 'Fed put; or quick return to financial repression are apt to be wrong this time,"" Shalett said. ""Fed credibility is on the line, and it is likely to risk overshooting rather than quitting the inflation fight too early."" — Alexandra Semenova is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2023-02-24,GC=F,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/fed-inflation-fight-longer-pce-index-173353572.html,"Two Federal Reserve officials suggested Friday morning that inflation could persist longer than thought after the central bank's most closely watched inflation gauge surged by the most in months. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Fed Governor Philip Jefferson said they remain concerned about an inflation rate that remains well above the Fed's 2% year-over-year target. Mester reiterated that while inflation has moderated, the overall level remains too high. She noted recent research from the Cleveland Fed and a discussion paper that have suggested inflation could be more persistent than currently anticipated. “I see the risks to the inflation forecast as tilted to the upside and the costs of continued high inflation as being significant,” Mester said at the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum in New York. “So in my view, at this point, with the labor market still strong, the costs of undershooting on policy or prematurely loosening policy still outweigh the costs of overshooting.” The comments came as the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation – the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index – unexpectedly accelerated in January, rising 5.4% last month on an annual basis. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the inflation gage rose 4.7%, both marking pickups after several months of declines. On a monthly basis, the PCE index rose 0.6% in January compared with December. Core prices also rose 0.6% in January from the prior month, compared with December’s 0.4% increase. The numbers Friday came a week after the government released the Consumer Price Index, which showed a similar pickup in the inflation rate. The hot read on inflation hit markets on renewed rate hike fears, with the Dow Jones Industrial average tanking 336 points. ""By betting on a terminal rate above 5.35%, the market is effectively betting that the recent momentum in both growth and inflation will be sustained through the summer,"" Jefferies chief economist Aneta Markowska said. Mester, who does not vote on monetary policy decisions this year, told Bloomberg in an interview Friday morning that the latest inflation reading shows the Fed needs to keep raising interest rates but stopped short of suggesting it required a 50-basis-point rate hike at the next policy meeting in March. Mester said last week she wanted to raise the benchmark policy rate by 50 basis points at the last policy meeting to try to get to the peak rate faster, though she also didn't want to surprise markets. In a separate interview Friday morning with CNBC, Mester signaled her forecast in December to raise rates a bit above 5% hasn’t changed much. Speaking at the same Monetary Policy Forum on Friday, Boston Fed President Susan Collins said inflation is still too high and that the Fed has more work to do. “Inflation remains too high, and recent data …all reinforce my view that we have more work to do, to bring inflation down to the 2 percent target,” said Collins. “I anticipate further rate increases to reach a sufficiently restrictive level, then holding there for some, perhaps extended, time.” Also speaking at the conference, Jefferson said a limited supply of workers for jobs needed, which has pushed up wages, suggests inflation may cool slowly. “The ongoing imbalance between the supply and demand for labor, combined with the large share of labor costs in the services sector, suggests that high inflation may come down only slowly,” he said. Jefferson also said the forces driving inflation now are different that past inflationary episodes and therefore economic models won’t be as helpful to policymakers. Jefferson said the current situation is different because the pandemic created unprecedented disruptions to global supply chains and is having a long-lasting impact on the labor participation rate. “The inflationary forces impinging on the U.S. economy at present represent a complex mixture of temporary and more long-lasting elements that defy simple, parsimonious explanation,” he said. Jefferson says he thinks the Fed is addressing the spike in inflation proactively, unlike in the 1970s and has more credibility now.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App. What's old may be new again for U.S. stock investors. The end of zero-interest rate policies (ZIRP) is likely to mark a shift in equity market favorites from long-leading technology names to sectors like energy, materials and housing — or what strategists at Bank of America deem part of ""the old economy."" ""Bear markets have historically resulted in leadership change, which suggests old economy sectors are likely the winners of this cycle,"" Savita Subramanian, BofA’s head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy said in a note earlier this week. With these components of the market depleted of capital over the past ten years as Big Tech was powered by free money, the ""pendulum is expected to swing back"" in their direction, Subramanian noted. Despite the big gains across January in these very stocks that were battered throughout 2022, investors have called the moves higher this year a bear market rally rather than the start of a new bull market. ""I think the stock market is in a protracted bear market,"" DoubleLine Capital founder and CEO Jeffrey Gundlach told Yahoo Finance Live in an interview Wednesday (video above), adding it began in the fourth quarter of 2021. ""[It's] very negative for the stock market when you have rising interest rates against these valuations, especially real interest rates,"" Gundlach said, adding a pause in the increase in real rates this fall was a catalyst for the recovery in risk assets. ""But it looks like real interest rates might start rising again."" Meanwhile on Sunday, Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson told clients in a not that the recent rally was ""a speculative frenzy"" based on false hopes for a pivot by the Federal Reserve. Equity markets are in the throes of a recent shift in the narrative for where interest rates will go, finally taking Fed officials at face value as they vow to lift their policy rate above 5% this year. Bank of America indicated its analysis of equity risk premium shows growth stocks were not pricing in recession risk and the expected higher-for-longer rate environment is projected to pressure long-duration growth stocks. Whatever the rest of the year holds for the U.S. stock market, signs have already emerged of an imminent change in leadership. Last year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average crushed the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite, for example, falling less than 10% in 2022 while the latter index wiped out more than one third of its value. As Yahoo Finance’s Jared Blikre pointed out, the Dow’s outperformance relative to the tech index was by far the biggest gap since the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. Goldman Sachs’s chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin warned in November that the ""exceptionalism of technology is arguably behind us. In 2022, the aggregate market capitalization of the current ""tetrad of largest stocks,"" as Goldman Sachs put it — Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) – fell to 18% from 22% the prior year. And those top four stocks lost an aggregate -25% compared to -13% for the remaining stocks in the index during the period. ""With the end of ZIRP, we see the pendulum swinging back to the old economy as prolonged underinvestment has led to supply issues in the old economy,"" Subramanian said. Bank of America itself raised metals to overweight, and is overweight energy, a testament to its confidence in the leadership transition.

All three major U.S. stock indexes were lower, with the S&P and the Nasdaq on course to post their largest weekly losses since September. The trading echoed Thursday's session, when SVB Financial Group's attempt to raise capital failed, spreading uncertainty through global financial stocks. ""There’s a building crisis of confidence in the financial community, the worry being that SVB is just the tip of the iceberg and more regional banks could admit to unanticipated financial challenges,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York. The U.S. economy added a more-than-expected 311,000 jobs last month, while the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked higher, along with the labor market participation rate. Hourly wage growth cooled on a monthly basis, but gained some heat year-on-year, albeit not as much as economists predicted. ""Even though the payrolls came in higher than expected, the underlying inflation indicators were more muted,"" Stovall added. ""This likely reduced the anxiety heading into next week’s inflation reports."" The data caps a week in which markets were preoccupied with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's hawkish two-day testimony before Congress, which moved the needle toward the likelihood that the central bank will hike its key policy rate by 50 basis points this month. Those expectations cooled following the jobs report. Financial markets are now pricing in a 41% chance of a 50 basis point rate hike and a 59% chance of a smaller, 25 basis point increase to the fed funds target rate at the conclusion of the March 21-22 monetary policy meeting. Analysts now look to Tuesday's consumer prices data, which will flesh out the February inflationary picture. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 42.57 points, or 0.13%, to 32,212.29, the S&P 500 lost 16.16 points, or 0.41%, to 3,902.16 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 65.33 points, or 0.58%, to 11,273.02. European stocks slid over uncertainty regarding tightening central bank policy, and looming worries over the health of the U.S. banking sector. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 1.67% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.61%. Emerging market stocks lost 1.03%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.46% lower, while Japan's Nikkei lost 1.67%. U.S. Treasury yields dropped, with the two-year yield setting a course for its biggest two-day drop since September 2008. ""(There is) a growing crisis of confidence that has triggered a flight to safety,"" Stovall said. ""Investors are fearful of a bank contagion and have flocked to the safety of Treasuries, elevating the price but reducing the yields."" Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 56/32 in price to yield 3.7064%, from 3.923% late on Thursday. The 30-year bond last rose 91/32 in price to yield 3.7074%, from 3.87% late on Thursday. The greenback weakened against a basket of world currencies after the payrolls report hinted at cooling inflation. The dollar index fell 1.06%, with the euro up 1.02% to $1.0688. The Japanese yen strengthened 1.27% versus the greenback at 134.46 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.2089, up 1.38% on the day. Oil prices stabilized after the jobs data, but remained on track to notch a 4% drop on the week over rate hike jitters. U.S. crude rose 0.13% to $75.82 per barrel and Brent was last at $81.66, up 0.09% on the day. Gold prices surged following the employment report as odds grew for a smaller increase to the Fed funds target rate. Spot gold added 1.8% to $1,864.29 an ounce.

2023-03-10,GC=F,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/china-australia-relations-western-australia-093000145.html,"Western Australia's premier is expected to make his first visit to China in four years by mid-April, and the trip is expected to include discussions about tourism development with officials and business representatives in Guangzhou, according to people with direct knowledge of the issue. Mark McGowan, 55, is also expected to stop in Beijing during the week-long trip, which is set to come amid improving bilateral and trade relations between China and Australia. ""It's still pending on who exactly he'll be meeting in Beijing,"" one of the sources added. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. ""In Guangzhou, the premier will discuss tourism development with officials and business representatives, including the direct flight route between Perth and Guangzhou."" On Thursday, Australia announced that it will drop pre-departure coronavirus testing requirements for travellers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau by Saturday. McGowan's office did not reply to a request for a comment about the trip, but in November, he committed to strengthening relationships with China, which Western Australia is ""dependent"" on for employment. He also said that Western Australia is set to continue to be an important investment location for China. China accounts for more than half of Western Australia's total goods exports and represents ""significant jobs"" for the region, McGowan said in November, according to the Australian Financial Review. McGowan also told the Post earlier that Western Australia expects to step up its space research cooperation with China as a way to utilise its copious scientific resources and boost up local innovation, investment and jobs. His trip would be the latest high-profile Australian official to visit China amid the improving relations that had turned sour during the previous Morrisson administration after Australian foreign minister Penny Wong met then-Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Beijing in December. The Post reported in February that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is ""anticipating"" his own visit to Beijing this year alongside the ""thawing ties"" between the two countries. A face-to-face meeting between Australian trade minister Don Farrell and China's commerce minister Wang Wentao is expected to pave the way for Albanese's trip after the pair met virtually at the start of February. Trade officials from China and Australia are also making progress with second and third rounds of discussions set to take place to eliminate barriers and talk through ""a broad range of trade and investment issues"" after a first meeting took place at the end of last month. On Thursday, Farrell said that Australia was seeing progress on almost all instances of trade blockages with China, with shipments of Australian coal set to arrive this month after Beijing lifted an unofficial ban that had been in place since 2020. ""My job is to convert those discussions into practical outcomes for Australian businesses,"" Farrell said in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, according to Reuters. Andrew Forrest, founder and executive chairman of the Perth-headquartered Fortescue Metals Group - the world's No 4 iron ore producer - is also expected to attend the Boao Forum for Asia later this month. China imports more than 60 per cent of its iron ore from Australia, figures from New York-based Seeking Alpha showed. ""Even in 2021, when relations were at their worst, China customs figures still showed that the country had imported 694 million tonnes of iron ore from Australia,"" the content service provider said in a blog post in December. ""Ultimately, this figure accounted for about 62 per cent of total imports."" McGowan on Wednesday was forced to comment on an issue involving China, claiming he ""didn't know"" about an alleged problem with gold bars sold by the Perth Mint to the Shanghai Gold Exchange during a time he had ministerial responsibility for the refinery. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Four Corners current affairs documentary series on Monday quoted a leaked internal report that the Perth Mint was facing a potential A$9 billion (US$5.93 billion) recall of gold bars after selling allegedly diluted bullion to China. While the gold remained above general industry standards, the report estimated up to 100 tonnes of gold sent to the Shanghai Gold Exchange potentially did not comply with its strict purity standards for silver content. The Perth Mint said on Wednesday that ""there is no question about the gold purity and value of the gold bars the Perth Mint has sold to customers in China"". It was made aware that some of its 1kg bars did not meet the non-gold specifications of the Shanghai Gold Exchange in September 2021, the company added. ""As part of the Perth Mint's review of refining practices, new processes were implemented,"" the company said.

2023-03-10,GC=F,https://finance.yahoo.com//news/india-newly-found-lithium-reserves-092000361.html,"The discovery of vast lithium deposits in the Indian territory of Jammu and Kashmir, hailed as a win for the country’s clean energy transition, comes at a price for communities in the Himalayan region, say villagers and environmental scientists. Often called “white gold”, the metal is a key component in lithium-ion storage batteries, which are crucial for electric vehicles because they are weight-for-weight far more efficient than the commonly used lead-acid or nickel-metal hydride batteries. Read more Here's how 10 industries are experimenting with ChatGPT Millennials are just as wealthy as their parents What can you do when your company reverses on remote work? The announcement in February of lithium deposits in the Reasi district of Jammu and Kashmir, estimated at 5.9 million tonnes, was welcome in a country committed to transitioning away from fossil fuels. India previously had to rely on lithium imports from countries such as Australia and Argentina. However, it comes amid reported subsidence of the Himalayan landscape triggered by the heavy machinery used to build dams and highways, raising concerns of further environmental damage. “Use of heavy machinery for drilling and earth-cutting in the sensitive Himalayan region has been largely responsible for subsidence in Joshimath town,” says SP Sati, who teaches environmental science at the College of Forestry, Ranichauri in the adjacent Himalayan state of Uttarakhand where the subsidence has been devastating in recent months. The residents of Reasi recognise the economic opportunities the lithium reserves can bring, but also the risks, as sinking houses force many to evacuate their homes to safer areas. “When we first came to know about the discovery of huge lithium reserves just adjacent to our village, we were happy that it will bring us prosperity. But we now hear that when the extraction takes place, it can prove hazardous for us and our water and land,” says Balbir Singh of Salal village which sits on the lithium deposits. “Even if we get some compensation for dislocation from our village, the thought of leaving the homes we have lived in for generations makes us very sad,” Singh says. Mohinder Singh Sarpanch, head of the village of Salal, says the village should be compensated for the impacts of mining in their community. “So far, we have not been officially asked to vacate our village. If residents from the entire area are required to vacate, then over 500 families will get affected,” Sarpanch says. “It is not only about dislocation; there will be pollution which we will have to bear if we are relocated to a nearby area. If we are asked to give these sacrifices for the country, the government has to think about us,” Sarpanch adds. It is not clear when the Indian government is planning to start lithium extraction, but experts say it could be years before commercial mining operations begin. “So far, only the primary resource calculation has been done. There are two more steps before we are sure about the exploitable resources and whether we will go for mining or not… it will take several years for the resources to be mined,” says Pankaj Srivastava, a professor who specialises in mineral exploration at the department of geology, University of Jammu. India would need to acquire specific technologies for mining and refining lithium, he added. According to Siddharth Goel, a senior policy advisor at the International Institute for Sustainable Development with experience in the fields of environment, energy and sustainable transport, lithium mine development can take 10 years or more. “However, it’s possible that India fast-tracks approvals and permits to reduce the time taken, given the critical importance of lithium in manufacturing electric vehicle batteries,” he says. S S Verma, a professor at the department of physics at Sant Longowal Institute of Engineering and Technology, in Longowal, Punjab state, says that India has a long history of working mines and lithium mining is not difficult, “but refining is (evidently) difficult”. Independent environmental impact assessments should be carried out before mining begins, given the sensitive ecology of the Himalayas, says Goel. “Ensuring an environmentally friendly mining process is also essential to attract investment from large international companies given the growing global scrutiny of the battery value chain’s environmental footprint,” he adds. Shakil Romshoo, senior professor in Kashmir University’s department of earth sciences, says: “The discovery of lithium in the country is a big development as India aggressively pursues clean energy production. But considering the significant environmental impacts of lithium extraction, environment-friendly exploration technology will be needed whenever this resource is exploited.” Lithium mining has sparked protests around the world in recent years. According to a study published in February in Nature, ecosystems in the vicinity of lithium deposits are “extremely fragile and linked in a food chain in which ecosystem services are crucial for livestock and rural populations”.

Many stocks from China have been heavily oversold last year, with p/e ratios dropping 30-40% from the peak in 2021, so they have the potential for a quicker rebound than their peers in the US, should the optimism get back to equity markets. Technically, all stock indices are now either in a consolidation or correction mode. Though, for HK50, there’s a strong support level ahead, built with a 200-day moving average. Should the price test this level, it may rebound higher and resume the bullish upswing. Natural gas is traded in a form of futures on New York Mercantile Exchange, which is the part of CME Group. According to reports from CFTC, net long position of commercial traders for natural gas futures has reached the 2-year peak. That usually represents an intermediate-term bullish signal. Warm winter’s temperatures had led to accumulation of substantial inventories on natural gas in Europe and the US: gas storage in Europe was around 60% with a seasonal average of 37%. Inventories for the US were almost 20% higher than their average for two years. This resulted in a massive drop of Natural gas prices. Technically, there was a parabolic acceleration to the downside, with a potentially reversal formation at the bottom. The price area of 2.7 – 3 has become a resistance, but the price action seems to be robust to sell-offs amid correction for oil and gold. There’s a possibility for Natural gas to test the level of 3 again, which may open the road to 3.5 – 4 area.

European and U.S. equity markets looked set to echo those losses when they reopen, with futures pointing lower. The yen weakened and Japanese government bond yields plunged after the Bank of Japan opted to keep stimulus settings steady at Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's last meeting in charge, as expected. The benchmark 10-year JGB yield, which the BOJ pins within 50 basis points either side of zero, pulled back sharply from that ceiling to last sit at 0.445%. The yen was last down about 0.4% at 136.615 per dollar after a knee-jerk drop of as much as 0.6%. Japan's Nikkei pared earlier losses to be down 1% after the central bank decision but selling began later in the session and the index was off 1.62% late in the day. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.7% to a two-month low, with banks and Hong Kong tech stocks leading losses. Australia's benchmark index S&P/ASX200 lost 2.28%. S&P 500 futures were down 0.73%, following the cash index dropping 1.8% and falling below its 200-day moving average. In early European trades, the pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures were down 1.56%, German DAX futures was 1.29% and FTSE futures was 1.43% lower. The U.S. dollar edged higher and short-end Treasuries extended sharp overnight gains - driving two-year yields down another 12 basis points to 4.7837% in Tokyo trading. Fed funds futures also rallied strongly, pulling the market-implied peak in U.S. rates from above 5.6% to just below 5.5%, and pricing about a 50% chance of a 50 basis point Fed hike this month, down from more than 70% a day earlier. The sharp moves followed SVB Financial Group, parent of startup-lender Silicon Valley Bank, noting a higher-than-expected ""cash burn"" from clients, falling deposits and rising costs of capital. It announced an equity sale hours after crypto-focused lender Silvergate said it was closing down. SVB stock was still sliding after the bell and has lost about 70% of its value in 24 hours. Shares of big banks were dragged down with it, with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co losing 5.4%, Citigroup down 4.1% and big lenders in Asia and Australia on the slide - albeit to a lesser extent - on Friday morning.
